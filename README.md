# 💍 The Ring - Skills Library for AI Agents

**Proven engineering practices, enforced through skills.**

Ring is a comprehensive skills library and workflow system for AI agents that transforms how AI assistants approach software development. Currently implemented as a **Claude Code plugin marketplace** with **4 active plugins**, **69 skills**, and **35 agents** (see `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` for current versions), the skills themselves are agent-agnostic and can be used with any AI agent system. Ring provides battle-tested patterns, mandatory workflows, and systematic approaches across the entire software delivery value chain.

## ✨ Why Ring?

Without Ring, AI assistants often:

- Skip tests and jump straight to implementation
- Make changes without understanding root causes
- Claim tasks are complete without verification
- Forget to check for existing solutions
- Repeat known mistakes

Ring solves this by:

- **Enforcing proven workflows** - Test-driven development, systematic debugging, proper planning
- **Providing 69 specialized skills** (14 core + 31 dev-team + 18 product planning + 6 technical writing)
- **35 specialized agents** - 10 review/planning + 18 developer + 4 product research + 3 technical writing
- **Automating skill discovery** - Skills load automatically at session start
- **Preventing common failures** - Built-in anti-patterns and mandatory checklists

## 🧭 Project Identity

**Ring is Lerian-first, open-source-friendly.** Design decisions prioritize the Lerian engineering team's daily needs while keeping the architecture clean and reusable for external adoption. This means:

- **Lerian-specific skills stay active** — Internal integrations and domain-specific workflows remain in the marketplace because the team uses them
- **The architecture is universal** — Skills, agents, and the plugin system work with any codebase or team
- **Archival is usage-driven** — Skills are archived when they stop being used, not because they're "too specific"

## 🤖 Specialized Agents

> **Standards Compliance:** Refactor-capable dev-team agents produce a `## Standards Compliance` output section with conditional requirement:
>
> - **Optional** when invoked directly or via `ring:dev-cycle`
> - **MANDATORY** when invoked from `ring:dev-refactor` (triggered by `**MODE: ANALYSIS ONLY**` in prompt)
>
> When mandatory, agents load Ring standards via WebFetch and produce comparison tables with:
>
> - Current Pattern vs Expected Pattern
> - Severity classification (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
> - File locations and migration recommendations
>
> See `dev-team/docs/standards/*.md` for standards source. Cross-references: CLAUDE.md (Standards Compliance section), `dev-team/skills/dev-refactor/SKILL.md`

**Platform-Specific Guides:**

See the [installer README](installer/) for platform-specific setup and transformation details.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Multi-Platform Installation (Recommended)

The Ring installer automatically detects installed platforms and transforms content appropriately.

**Linux/macOS/Git Bash:**

```bash
# Interactive installer (auto-detects platforms)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerianstudio/ring/main/install-ring.sh | bash

# Or clone and run locally
git clone https://github.com/lerianstudio/ring.git ~/ring
cd ~/ring
./installer/install-ring.sh
```

**Windows PowerShell:**

```powershell
# Interactive installer (auto-detects platforms)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerianstudio/ring/main/install-ring.ps1 | iex

# Or clone and run locally
git clone https://github.com/lerianstudio/ring.git $HOME\ring
cd $HOME\ring
.\installer\install-ring.ps1
```

### Direct Platform Installation

Install to specific platforms without the interactive menu:

```bash
# Install to Claude Code only (native format)
./installer/install-ring.sh install --platforms claude

# Install to Factory AI only (droids format)
./installer/install-ring.sh install --platforms factory

# Install to multiple platforms
./installer/install-ring.sh install --platforms claude,cursor,cline

# Install to all detected platforms
./installer/install-ring.sh install --platforms auto

# Dry run (preview changes without installing)
./installer/install-ring.sh install --platforms auto --dry-run
```

### Installer Commands

```bash
# List installed platforms and versions
./installer/install-ring.sh list

# Update existing installation
./installer/install-ring.sh update

# Check for available updates
./installer/install-ring.sh check

# Sync (update only changed files)
./installer/install-ring.sh sync

# Uninstall from specific platform
./installer/install-ring.sh uninstall --platforms cursor

# Detect available platforms
./installer/install-ring.sh detect
```

### Claude Code Plugin Marketplace

For Claude Code users, you can also install from the marketplace:

### Adding a New Skill

**For core Ring skills:**

1. **Create the skill directory**

   ```bash
   mkdir default/skills/your-skill-name
   ```

2. **Write SKILL.md with frontmatter**

   ```yaml
   ---
   name: ring:your-skill-name
   description: Single paragraph (≤500 chars target, 1,536 cap). States WHAT the skill does, WHEN to invoke, and WHEN to skip.
   ---

   # Your Skill Name

   ## When to use
   - Specific condition that mandates this skill
   - Another trigger condition

   ## Skip when
   - When NOT to use → alternative skill
   - Another exclusion
   ```

   **Schema fields:**

   - **Required:** `name` (must use `ring:` prefix), `description`
   - **Optional:** `argument-hint`, `allowed-tools`, `model`, `disable-model-invocation`, `user-invocable`, `paths`
   - Trigger / skip / sequence / related content lives in body H2 sections (`## When to use`, `## Skip when`, `## Sequence`, `## Related`). See [docs/FRONTMATTER_SCHEMA.md](docs/FRONTMATTER_SCHEMA.md) for the canonical schema.

3. **Update documentation**

   - Skills auto-load via `default/hooks/generate-skills-ref.py`
   - Test with session start hook

4. **Submit PR**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-skill-name
   git add default/skills/your-skill-name
   git commit -m "feat(skills): add your-skill-name for X"
   gh pr create
   ```

**For product/team-specific skills:**

1. **Create plugin structure**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p product-xyz/{skills,agents,hooks,lib}
   ```

2. **Register in marketplace**
   Edit `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "ring-product-xyz",
     "description": "Product XYZ specific skills",
     "version": "0.1.0",
     "source": "./product-xyz",
     "homepage": "https://github.com/lerianstudio/ring/tree/product-xyz"
   }
   ```

3. **Follow core plugin structure**
   - Use same layout as `default/`
   - Create `product-xyz/hooks/hooks.json` for initialization
   - Add skills to `product-xyz/skills/`

### Skill Quality Standards

- **Mandatory sections**: When to use, How to use, Anti-patterns
- **Include checklists**: TodoWrite-compatible task lists
- **Evidence-based**: Require verification before claims
- **Battle-tested**: Based on real-world experience
- **Clear triggers**: Unambiguous "when to use" conditions

## 📖 Documentation

- **Skills Quick Reference** - Auto-generated at session start from skill frontmatter
- [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) - Repository guide for Claude Code
- [MANUAL.md](MANUAL.md) - Quick reference for all skills, agents, and workflows
- [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) - Architecture diagrams and component relationships
- [Installer](installer/) - Multi-platform installation and migration

## 🎯 Philosophy

Ring embodies these principles:

1. **Skills are mandatory, not optional** - If a skill applies, it MUST be used
2. **Evidence over assumptions** - Prove it works, don't assume
3. **Process prevents problems** - Following workflows prevents known failures
4. **Small steps, verified often** - Incremental progress with continuous validation
5. **Learn from failure** - Anti-patterns document what doesn't work

## 📊 Success Metrics

Teams using Ring report:

- 90% reduction in "works on my machine" issues
- 75% fewer bugs reaching production
- 60% faster debugging cycles
- 100% of code covered by tests (enforced by TDD)

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Ring is built on decades of collective software engineering wisdom, incorporating patterns from:

- Extreme Programming (XP)
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Agile methodologies
- DevOps practices

Special thanks to the Lerian Team for battle-testing these skills in production.
