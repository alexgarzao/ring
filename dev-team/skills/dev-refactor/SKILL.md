description: Analyzes backend codebase (Go/TypeScript) against standards and generates refactoring tasks for ring:dev-cycle. For frontend projects, use ring:dev-refactor-frontend instead.
trigger: |
  - User wants to refactor existing project to follow standards
  - Legacy codebase needs modernization
  - Project audit requested

  - Greenfield project → Use /pre-dev-* instead

# Dev Refactor Skill

Analyzes existing backend codebase against Ring/Lerian standards and generates refactoring tasks for ring:dev-cycle.

You orchestrate. Agents analyze. NEVER run Bash/Grep/Read to analyze code directly — dispatch agents.

## Gap Principle

Every divergence from Ring standards = a mandatory gap to implement. No exceptions.

All divergences → FINDING-XXX → REFACTOR-XXX task → ring:dev-cycle input.

## Architecture Pattern Applicability

| Service Type | Apply Hexagonal/Lerian Pattern? |
|---|---|
| CRUD API | ✅ YES |
| Complex business logic | ✅ YES |
| Event-driven systems | ✅ YES |
| CLI tools / scripts | ❌ NO |
| Workers / background jobs | ❌ NO |
| Simple lambdas | ❌ NO |

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Validate Prerequisites

- Check `docs/PROJECT_RULES.md` exists → STOP if missing
- Detect stack: `go.mod` → Go; `package.json` + Express/Fastify/NestJS (no React) → TypeScript
- If `package.json` + React/Next.js → STOP: use `ring:dev-refactor-frontend`

### Step 2: Generate Codebase Report

Dispatch `ring:codebase-explorer`:

```
Generate comprehensive codebase report: project structure, architecture pattern,
tech stack, code patterns (config, database, handlers, errors, telemetry, testing),
key files inventory with file:line references, code snippets.
Output: docs/ring:dev-refactor/{timestamp}/codebase-report.md
```

### Step 3: Dispatch Specialist Agents (parallel)

Verify `codebase-report.md` exists before dispatching.

**For Go projects — dispatch all 5 in parallel (single message):**

```yaml
Task 1: ring:backend-engineer-golang (MODE: ANALYSIS only)
  - Load golang.md via WebFetch
  - Check all sections per shared-patterns/standards-coverage-table.md
  - Flag framework/library mismatches vs standards
  - File size enforcement: >1000 lines = ISSUE-XXX (HIGH), >1500 = CRITICAL
  - Multi-tenant analysis per shared-patterns/multi-tenant-analysis.md
  - Output: Standards Coverage Table + ISSUE-XXX per finding

Task 2: ring:qa-analyst (MODE: ANALYSIS only)
  - Check all testing sections per standards-coverage-table.md
  - Output: Standards Coverage Table + ISSUE-XXX for gaps

Task 3: ring:devops-engineer (MODE: ANALYSIS only)
  - Check Dockerfile, Docker Compose, Makefile, CI/CD
  - Output: Standards Coverage Table + ISSUE-XXX for gaps

Task 4: ring:sre (MODE: ANALYSIS only)
  - Check observability (logging, tracing, metrics, readyz)
  - Output: Standards Coverage Table + ISSUE-XXX for gaps

Task 5: ring:qa-analyst (test_mode: goroutine-leak) (MODE: ANALYSIS only)
  - Detect goroutine usage; flag leaks
  - Output: ISSUE-XXX for each leak pattern
```

**For TypeScript projects — dispatch 4 in parallel:**
Tasks 1-4 using `ring:backend-engineer-typescript` for Task 1.

### Step 4: Map Findings → Tasks

After all agents complete:

1. Save individual agent reports to `docs/ring:dev-refactor/{timestamp}/`
2. Map each ISSUE-XXX → FINDING-XXX (normalize severity, add file:line, current vs expected)
3. Generate `docs/ring:dev-refactor/{timestamp}/findings.md`
4. Map each FINDING-XXX → one REFACTOR-XXX task (1:1 mapping)
5. Generate `docs/ring:dev-refactor/{timestamp}/tasks.md` (ring:dev-cycle compatible)

**Findings template:**
```markdown
# {project-name} Refactor Findings

## FINDING-001: {Pattern Name} in {file_path}
- **Severity:** CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
- **File:** {path}:{line}
- **Current:** {code or description}
- **Expected:** {Ring standard}
- **Standard Reference:** {standards doc section}
```

**Tasks template:**
```markdown
# {project-name} Refactor Tasks

## REFACTOR-001: {Pattern Name} in {file_path}
- **Finding:** FINDING-001
- **Estimated Complexity:** trivial | moderate | complex
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] {specific, testable criteria}
```

### Step 5: Visual Change Report + User Approval

Generate visual HTML summary of KILL/CHANGE/ADD operations → dispatch `ring:visualize`.

Present to user for approval. Wait for explicit APPROVED.

### Step 6: Save + Handoff

Save all artifacts to `docs/ring:dev-refactor/{timestamp}/`.

Handoff to `ring:dev-cycle`: feed tasks.md as input.

## Agent Analysis Report Template

```markdown
# {Agent Name} Analysis Report

## EXPLORATION SUMMARY
High-level architecture assessment

## KEY FINDINGS
ISSUE-XXX list with file:line, current, expected

## ARCHITECTURE INSIGHTS
Patterns detected, notable deviations

## RELEVANT FILES
Files most impacted by findings

## RECOMMENDATIONS
Priority order for refactoring
```
