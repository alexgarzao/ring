# Using Ring Developer Specialists

## When to use
- Need deep expertise for specific technology (Go, TypeScript)
- Backend local runtime / docker-compose → ring:backend-engineer-golang or ring:backend-engineer-typescript
- Frontend with design focus → ring:frontend-designer
- Frontend UI development (React/Next.js) → ring:frontend-engineer
- Frontend from product-designer specs → ring:ui-engineer
- Helm chart creation/maintenance → ring:helm-engineer
- Backend tests / coverage / TDD → ring:backend-engineer-golang or ring:backend-engineer-typescript
- Frontend test strategy → ring:qa-analyst-frontend
- Backend health/logging/tracing → ring:backend-engineer-golang or ring:backend-engineer-typescript
- Agent/prompt quality evaluation → ring:prompt-quality-reviewer
- Migrating deprecated lib-commons observability shims to lib-observability → ring:migrate-observability

## Skip when
- General code review → use default plugin reviewers
- Debugging → trace from logs / metrics / telemetry

Developer specialist agents. Dispatch via `Task tool with subagent_type:`.

## Runtime Version Resolution

Always resolve lib-commons to latest v5.x at runtime:
```bash
gh api repos/LerianStudio/lib-commons/releases/latest --jq '.tag_name'
```
Do NOT hardcode specific patch versions.

## Dispatch Template

```yaml
Task:
  subagent_type: "ring:{agent-name}"
  description: "{Brief task description}"
  prompt: |
    {Your specific request with full context}
```

## Frontend Agent Selection Guide

| Need | Agent |
|------|-------|
| Visual aesthetics, design specs (no code) | `ring:frontend-designer` |
| React/Next.js UI development | `ring:frontend-engineer` |
| Business logic, BFF, Clean Architecture | `ring:frontend-bff-engineer-typescript` |
| Implementing from wireframes/ux-criteria | `ring:ui-engineer` |

## Parallelization

When tasks are independent, dispatch multiple agents in ONE message:

```yaml
# All in one Task call block
Task 1: ring:backend-engineer-golang - implement X with TDD, coverage, and local runtime
Task 2: ring:backend-engineer-typescript - implement Y with TDD, coverage, and local runtime
Task 3: ring:helm-engineer - update Helm chart
```

Sequential dispatch triples execution time for the same cost.

## Example

```yaml
Task:
  subagent_type: "ring:backend-engineer-golang"
  description: "Implement multi-tenant repository for accounts"
  prompt: |
    Implement a multi-tenant PostgreSQL repository for the accounts domain.
    
    Standards: Load golang.md and multi-tenant.md via WebFetch.
    Project rules: docs/PROJECT_RULES.md
    
    Requirements:
    - Use tmcore.GetPGContext(ctx) for tenant context resolution
    - Table: accounts, tenant isolation via schema-per-tenant
    - TDD: write failing test first, then implement
    
    Output: files created, test results, acceptance criteria checklist
```
