  10-gate development cycle orchestrator with subtask/task/cycle cadence.
  Subtask-level: Gate 0 (implementation + delivery verification), Gate 3 (unit testing), Gate 9 (validation).
  Task-level: Gates 1-2, 4-8 (devops, SRE, fuzz, property, integration write, chaos write, review).
  Cycle-end: Gates 6-7 execute, multi-tenant verify, dev-report, final commit.

trigger: |
  - Starting a new development cycle with a task file
  - Resuming an interrupted development cycle
  - Need structured, gate-based task execution with quality checkpoints

skip_when: |
  - No tasks file exists
  - Task is documentation-only or planning-only
  - Frontend project (use ring:dev-cycle-frontend instead)

# Development Cycle Orchestrator

You orchestrate. Agents execute. You NEVER read, write, or edit source code directly.

## How This Works

Load tasks from PM output, execute through 10 gates at three cadences. Each gate loads its own sub-skill which tells you how to dispatch the specialist agent.

**Announce at start:** "Using ring:dev-cycle to orchestrate through 10 gates (0-9)."

## Gate Map

| Gate | Skill to Load | Agent to Dispatch | Cadence | Mode |
|------|---------------|-------------------|---------|------|
| 0 | ring:dev-implementation | ring:backend-engineer-* | Per subtask | Write + Run |
| 1 | ring:dev-devops | ring:devops-engineer | Per task | Write + Run |
| 2 | ring:dev-sre | ring:sre | Per task | Write + Run |
| 3 | ring:dev-unit-testing | ring:qa-analyst (unit) | Per subtask | Write + Run |
| 4 | ring:dev-fuzz-testing | ring:qa-analyst (fuzz) | Per task | Write + Run |
| 5 | ring:dev-property-testing | ring:qa-analyst (property) | Per task | Write + Run |
| 6 | ring:dev-integration-testing | ring:qa-analyst (integration) | Per task | Write only* |
| 7 | ring:dev-chaos-testing | ring:qa-analyst (chaos) | Per task | Write only* |
| 8 | ring:codereview | 10 reviewers in parallel | Per task | Run |
| 9 | ring:dev-validation | N/A (verification) | Per subtask | Run |

*Gates 6-7 write test code per task, execute once at end of cycle (containers spun up once).

All gates are mandatory. No exceptions.

## Execution Order

```yaml
for each task:

  # SUBTASK-LEVEL (per subtask, or task-itself if no subtasks)
  for each subtask:
    Gate 0 → Gate 3 → Gate 9
    [checkpoint if manual_per_subtask mode]

  # TASK-LEVEL (once per task, after all subtasks done)
  Gate 1 → Gate 2 → Gate 4 → Gate 5 → Gate 6 write → Gate 7 write → Gate 8

# CYCLE-END (once, after all tasks done)
Gate 6 execute → Gate 7 execute → Multi-Tenant Verify → dev-report → Final Commit
```

## Gate Execution Workflow

For EVERY gate, follow this exact sequence:

```
1. Read gate-specific instructions  → Read("gates/gate-{N}.md") from this skill directory
2. Load sub-skill                   → Skill("ring:{sub-skill-name}")
3. Follow sub-skill dispatch rules  → Sub-skill tells you HOW to dispatch
4. Dispatch agent                   → Task(subagent_type="ring:{agent}", ...)
5. Validate agent output            → Per sub-skill validation rules
6. Update state                     → Write to current-cycle.json
7. Next gate or checkpoint
```

Never dispatch an agent without loading the sub-skill first.
Never skip from standards → agent directly. Always: standards → sub-skill → agent.

## Standards Loading

At cycle start (Step 1.5), pre-cache Ring standards:

1. WebFetch the standards index for the project language (e.g., `golang/_index.md`)
2. Store cached standards in `state.cached_standards`
3. Pass relevant modules to agents at dispatch time — do NOT re-fetch per gate

## Orchestrator Boundaries

**You CAN:** Read task/state files, write state files, track progress, dispatch agents, ask user questions, WebFetch standards.

**You CANNOT:** Read/write/edit source code (*.go, *.ts, *.tsx), run tests, analyze code directly, make architectural decisions.

If a task involves source code → dispatch specialist agent. No exceptions regardless of file count or simplicity.

## State Management

State lives in `docs/ring:dev-cycle/current-cycle.json` (or `docs/ring:dev-refactor/current-cycle.json`).

For state schema, persistence rules, and initialization logic, read `gates/state-schema.md` from this skill directory.

**Critical rule:** Write state after EVERY gate completion. If state write fails → STOP. Never proceed without persisted state.

## PROJECT_RULES.md Check

Before starting any gate execution, verify `docs/PROJECT_RULES.md` exists.

For the full verification process and template creation flow, read `gates/project-rules-check.md` from this skill directory.

If PROJECT_RULES.md doesn't exist → create it using the Ring template before proceeding.

## Execution Modes

Ask user at cycle start:

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `automatic` | All gates execute, pause only on failure |
| `manual_per_task` | Checkpoint after each task completes all gates |
| `manual_per_subtask` | Checkpoint after each subtask completes subtask-level gates |

Mode affects CHECKPOINTS (user approval pauses), not GATES. All gates execute regardless of mode.

## Custom Instructions

If user provides custom context at cycle start, store in `state.custom_prompt` and inject at the top of every agent dispatch:

```
**CUSTOM CONTEXT (from user):**
{state.custom_prompt}

---

**Standard Instructions:**
[... agent prompt ...]
```

## Commit Timing

- Gate 0 (implementation): Commit after GREEN phase passes
- Gates 1-7 (infra + testing): Commit after each gate passes
- Gate 8 (review): Commit fixes after all reviewers pass
- Gate 9 (validation): No commit (verification only)
- Cycle-end: Final commit with cycle metadata

Convention: `feat|fix|test|chore(scope): description` — keep commits atomic per gate.

## Blocker Handling

| Blocker | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Gate failure (tests not passing, review failed) | STOP. Cannot proceed to next gate. |
| Missing PROJECT_RULES.md | STOP. Create using template. |
| Agent error | STOP. Diagnose and report. |
| Architectural decision needed | STOP. Present options to user. |

## Gate Completion Rules

A gate is complete ONLY when ALL components succeed:
- Gate 0: TDD RED + GREEN + delivery verification (all requirements delivered, 0 dead code)
- Gate 3: Coverage ≥ 85% + all acceptance criteria tested
- Gate 8: ALL 10 reviewers pass. 9/10 = FAIL → re-run all 10.
- Gate 9: Explicit "APPROVED" from user

## Severity of Issues

- CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM found in review → Fix NOW, re-run all reviewers
- LOW → Add `TODO(review):` comment
- Cosmetic → Add `FIXME(nitpick):` comment

## Error Recovery

| Scenario | Recovery |
|----------|----------|
| Agent returns error | Retry with clearer instructions (max 3 attempts) |
| State file corrupted | Rebuild from git log + last known state |
| Gate stuck in loop | After 3 iterations, escalate to user |
| Context limit reached | Use `/ring:create-handoff` → resume in new session |

## Input Sources

| Source | Path |
|--------|------|
| Tasks (PM output) | `docs/pre-dev/{feature}/tasks.md` |
| Subtasks | `docs/pre-dev/{feature}/subtasks/{task-id}/ST-XXX-01.md` |
| Refactor tasks | `docs/ring:dev-refactor/*/tasks.md` |

## Frontend Handoff

If frontend tasks are detected in a backend cycle → create a handoff file listing frontend requirements, API contracts, and test expectations. Frontend uses `ring:dev-cycle-frontend` separately.
