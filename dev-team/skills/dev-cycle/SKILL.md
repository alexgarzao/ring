description: |
  Main orchestrator for the 6-gate development cycle system. Loads tasks/subtasks
  from PM team output and executes through implementation, devops, SRE, testing, review,
  and validation gates with state persistence and metrics collection.

trigger: |
  - Starting a new development cycle with a task file
  - Resuming an interrupted development cycle (--resume flag)
  - Need structured, gate-based task execution with quality checkpoints

skip_when: |
  - Already in a specific gate skill -> let that gate complete
  - Need to plan tasks first -> use writing-plans or pre-dev-full
  - Human explicitly requests manual implementation (non-AI workflow)

NOT_skip_when: |
  - "Task is simple" → Simple ≠ risk-free. Execute gates.
  - "Tests already pass" → Tests ≠ review. Different concerns.
  - "Time pressure" → Pressure ≠ permission. Document and proceed.
  - "Already did N gates" → Sunk cost is irrelevant. Complete all gates.

# Development Cycle Orchestrator

## Standards Loading (MANDATORY)

**Before ANY gate execution, you MUST load Ring standards:**

See [CLAUDE.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/CLAUDE.md) as the canonical source. This table summarizes the loading process.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| url | \`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/CLAUDE.md\` |
| prompt | "Extract Agent Modification Verification requirements, Anti-Rationalization Tables requirements, and Critical Rules" |

**Execute WebFetch before proceeding.** Do NOT continue until standards are loaded.

If WebFetch fails → STOP and report blocker. Cannot proceed without Ring standards.

## Overview

The development cycle orchestrator loads tasks/subtasks from PM team output (or manual task files) and executes through 6 quality gates. Tasks are loaded at initialization - no separate import gate.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the dev-cycle skill to orchestrate task execution through 6 gates."

## ⛔ CRITICAL: Specialized Agents Perform All Tasks

See [shared-patterns/shared-orchestrator-principle.md](../shared-patterns/shared-orchestrator-principle.md) for full ORCHESTRATOR principle, role separation, forbidden/required actions, gate-to-agent mapping, and anti-rationalization table.

**Summary:** You orchestrate. Agents execute. If using Read/Write/Edit/Bash on source code → STOP. Dispatch agent.

## ⛔ ORCHESTRATOR BOUNDARIES (HARD GATE)

**This section defines exactly what the orchestrator CAN and CANNOT do.**

### What Orchestrator CAN Do (PERMITTED)

| Action | Tool | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Read task files | `Read` | Load task definitions from `docs/pre-dev/*/tasks.md` |
| Read state files | `Read` | Load/verify `docs/refactor/current-cycle.json` |
| Read PROJECT_RULES.md | `Read` | Load project-specific rules |
| Write state files | `Write` | Persist cycle state to JSON |
| Track progress | `TodoWrite` | Maintain task list |
| Dispatch agents | `Task` | Send work to specialist agents |
| Ask user questions | `AskUserQuestion` | Get execution mode, approvals |
| WebFetch standards | `WebFetch` | Load Ring standards |

### What Orchestrator CANNOT Do (FORBIDDEN)

| Action | Tool | Why FORBIDDEN |
|--------|------|---------------|
| Read source code | `Read` on `*.go`, `*.ts`, `*.tsx` | Agent reads code, not orchestrator |
| Write source code | `Write`/`Create` on `*.go`, `*.ts` | Agent writes code, not orchestrator |
| Edit source code | `Edit` on `*.go`, `*.ts`, `*.tsx` | Agent edits code, not orchestrator |
| Run tests | `Execute` with `go test`, `npm test` | Agent runs tests in TDD cycle |
| Analyze code | Direct pattern analysis | `codebase-explorer` analyzes |
| Make architectural decisions | Choosing patterns/libraries | User decides, agent implements |

### The 3-FILE RULE

**If a task requires editing MORE than 3 files → MUST dispatch specialist agent.**

This is NOT negotiable:
- 1-3 files of non-source content (markdown, json, yaml) → Orchestrator MAY edit directly
- 1+ source code files (`*.go`, `*.ts`, `*.tsx`) → MUST dispatch agent
- 4+ files of ANY type → MUST dispatch agent

### Orchestrator Workflow Order (MANDATORY)

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CORRECT WORKFLOW ORDER                                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│  1. Load task file (Read docs/pre-dev/*/tasks.md)              │
│  2. Ask execution mode (AskUserQuestion)                        │
│  3. Check/Load state (Read docs/refactor/current-cycle.json)   │
│  4. WebFetch Ring Standards                                     │
│  5. ⛔ DISPATCH SPECIALIST AGENT ← Immediate after standards   │
│  6. Wait for agent completion                                   │
│  7. Verify agent output (Standards Coverage Table)              │
│  8. Update state (Write to JSON)                               │
│  9. Proceed to next gate                                        │
│                                                                 │
│  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════   │
│  ❌ WRONG: Load → Mode → Standards → [START CODING DIRECTLY]   │
│  ✅ RIGHT: Load → Mode → Standards → DISPATCH AGENT → Wait     │
│  ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Agent Dispatch is IMMEDIATE (HARD GATE)

**The moment you identify the task language/type, dispatch the agent. No intermediate steps.**

| Task Type | Immediate Action |
|-----------|------------------|
| Go implementation | `Task(subagent_type="backend-engineer-golang", ...)` |
| TypeScript backend | `Task(subagent_type="backend-engineer-typescript", ...)` |
| React/Frontend | `Task(subagent_type="frontend-engineer", ...)` |
| BFF layer | `Task(subagent_type="frontend-bff-engineer-typescript", ...)` |
| Infrastructure | `Task(subagent_type="devops-engineer", ...)` |
| Observability validation | `Task(subagent_type="sre", ...)` |
| Testing | `Task(subagent_type="qa-analyst", ...)` |
| Code review | 3 parallel: `code-reviewer`, `business-logic-reviewer`, `security-reviewer` |

**Between "WebFetch standards" and "Dispatch agent" there should be ZERO other actions.**

### Anti-Rationalization for Direct Coding

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "It's just one small file" | File count doesn't determine agent need. Language does. | **DISPATCH specialist agent** |
| "I already loaded the standards" | Loading standards ≠ permission to implement. Standards are for AGENTS. | **DISPATCH specialist agent** |
| "Agent dispatch adds overhead" | Overhead ensures compliance. Skip = skip verification. | **DISPATCH specialist agent** |
| "I can write Go/TypeScript" | Knowing language ≠ having Ring standards loaded. Agent has them. | **DISPATCH specialist agent** |
| "Just a quick fix" | "Quick" is irrelevant. ALL source changes require specialist. | **DISPATCH specialist agent** |
| "I'll read the file first to understand" | Reading source → temptation to edit. Agent reads for you. | **DISPATCH specialist agent** |
| "Let me check if tests pass first" | Agent runs tests in TDD cycle. You don't run tests. | **DISPATCH specialist agent** |

### Red Flags - Orchestrator Violation in Progress

**If you catch yourself doing ANY of these, STOP IMMEDIATELY:**

```text
🚨 RED FLAG: About to Read *.go or *.ts file
   → STOP. Dispatch agent instead.

🚨 RED FLAG: About to Write/Create source code
   → STOP. Dispatch agent instead.

🚨 RED FLAG: About to Edit source code
   → STOP. Dispatch agent instead.

🚨 RED FLAG: About to run "go test" or "npm test"
   → STOP. Agent runs tests, not you.

🚨 RED FLAG: Thinking "I'll just..."
   → STOP. "Just" is the warning word. Dispatch agent.

🚨 RED FLAG: Thinking "This is simple enough..."
   → STOP. Simplicity is irrelevant. Dispatch agent.

🚨 RED FLAG: Standards loaded, but next action is NOT Task tool
   → STOP. After standards, IMMEDIATELY dispatch agent.
```

### Recovery from Orchestrator Violation

If you violated orchestrator boundaries:

1. **STOP** current execution immediately
2. **DISCARD** any direct changes (`git checkout -- .`)
3. **DISPATCH** the correct specialist agent
4. **Agent implements** from scratch following TDD
5. **Document** the violation for feedback loop

**Sunk cost of direct work is IRRELEVANT. Agent dispatch is MANDATORY.**

## Blocker Criteria - STOP and Report

| Decision Type | Examples | Action |
|---------------|----------|--------|
| **Gate Failure** | Tests not passing, review failed | STOP. Cannot proceed to next gate. |
| **Missing Standards** | No PROJECT_RULES.md | STOP. Report blocker and wait. |
| **Agent Failure** | Specialist agent returned errors | STOP. Diagnose and report. |
| **User Decision Required** | Architecture choice, framework selection | STOP. Present options with trade-offs. |

You CANNOT proceed when blocked. Report and wait for resolution.

### Cannot Be Overridden

| Requirement | Rationale | Consequence If Skipped |
|-------------|-----------|------------------------|
| **All 6 gates must execute** | Each gate catches different issues | Missing critical defects, security vulnerabilities |
| **Gates execute in order (0→5)** | Dependencies exist between gates | Testing untested code, reviewing unobservable systems |
| **Gate 4 requires ALL 3 reviewers** | Different review perspectives are complementary | Missing security issues, business logic flaws |
| **Coverage threshold ≥ 85%** | Industry standard for quality code | Untested edge cases, regression risks |
| **PROJECT_RULES.md must exist** | Cannot verify standards without target | Arbitrary decisions, inconsistent implementations |

## Severity Calibration

| Severity | Criteria | Examples |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** | Blocks deployment, security risk, data loss | Gate violation, skipped mandatory step |
| **HIGH** | Major functionality broken, standards violation | Missing tests, wrong agent dispatched |
| **MEDIUM** | Code quality, maintainability issues | Incomplete documentation, minor gaps |
| **LOW** | Best practices, optimization | Style improvements, minor refactoring |

Report ALL severities. Let user prioritize.

### Reviewer Verdicts Are Final

**MEDIUM issues found in Gate 4 MUST be fixed. No exceptions.**

| Request | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Can reviewer clarify if MEDIUM can defer?" | Reviewer already decided. MEDIUM means FIX. | **Fix the issue, re-run reviewers** |
| "Ask if this specific case is different" | Reviewer verdict accounts for context already. | **Fix the issue, re-run reviewers** |
| "Request exception for business reasons" | Reviewers know business context. Verdict is final. | **Fix the issue, re-run reviewers** |

**Severity mapping is absolute:**
- CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM → Fix NOW, re-run all 3 reviewers
- LOW → Add TODO(review): comment
- Cosmetic → Add FIXME(nitpick): comment

No negotiation. No exceptions. No "special cases".

## Pressure Resistance

See [shared-patterns/shared-pressure-resistance.md](../shared-patterns/shared-pressure-resistance.md) for universal pressure scenarios.

**Gate-specific note:** Execution mode selection affects CHECKPOINTS (user approval pauses), not GATES (quality checks). ALL gates execute regardless of mode.

## Common Rationalizations - REJECTED

See [shared-patterns/shared-anti-rationalization.md](../shared-patterns/shared-anti-rationalization.md) for universal anti-rationalizations.

**Gate-specific rationalizations:**

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Automatic mode means faster" | Automatic mode skips CHECKPOINTS, not GATES. Same quality, less interruption. |
| "Automatic mode will skip review" | Automatic mode affects user approval pauses, NOT quality gates. ALL gates execute regardless. |
| "Defense in depth exists (frontend validates)" | Frontend can be bypassed. Backend is the last line. Fix at source. |
| "Backlog the Medium issue, it's documented" | Documented risk ≠ mitigated risk. Medium in Gate 4 = fix NOW, not later. |
| "Risk-based prioritization allows deferral" | Gates ARE the risk-based system. Reviewers define severity, not you. |

## Red Flags - STOP

See [shared-patterns/shared-red-flags.md](../shared-patterns/shared-red-flags.md) for universal red flags.

If you catch yourself thinking ANY of those patterns, STOP immediately and return to gate execution.

## Incremental Compromise Prevention

**The "just this once" pattern leads to complete gate erosion:**

```text
Day 1: "Skip review just this once" → Approved (precedent set)
Day 2: "Skip testing, we did it last time" → Approved (precedent extended)
Day 3: "Skip implementation checks, pattern established" → Approved (gates meaningless)
Day 4: Production incident from Day 1 code
```

**Prevention rules:**
1. **No incremental exceptions** - Each exception becomes the new baseline
2. **Document every pressure** - Log who requested, why, outcome
3. **Escalate patterns** - If same pressure repeats, escalate to team lead
4. **Gates are binary** - Complete or incomplete. No "mostly done".

## Gate Completion Definition (HARD GATE)

**A gate is COMPLETE only when ALL components finish successfully:**

| Gate | Components Required | Partial = FAIL |
|------|---------------------|----------------|
| 0.1 | TDD-RED: Failing test written + failure output captured | Test exists but no failure output = FAIL |
| 0.2 | TDD-GREEN: Implementation passes test | Code exists but test fails = FAIL |
| 0 | Both 0.1 and 0.2 complete | 0.1 done without 0.2 = FAIL |
| 1 | Dockerfile + docker-compose + .env.example | Missing any = FAIL |
| 2 | Structured JSON logs with trace correlation | Partial structured logs = FAIL |
| 3 | Coverage ≥ 85% + all AC tested | 84% = FAIL |
| 4 | **ALL 3 reviewers PASS** | 2/3 reviewers = FAIL |
| 5 | Explicit "APPROVED" from user | "Looks good" = NOT approved |

**CRITICAL for Gate 4:** Running 2 of 3 reviewers is NOT a partial pass - it's a FAIL. Re-run ALL 3 reviewers.

**Anti-Rationalization for Partial Gates:**

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "2 of 3 reviewers passed" | Gate 4 requires ALL 3. 2/3 = 0/3. | **Re-run ALL 3 reviewers** |
| "Gate mostly complete" | Mostly ≠ complete. Binary: done or not done. | **Complete ALL components** |
| "Can finish remaining in next cycle" | Gates don't carry over. Complete NOW. | **Finish current gate** |
| "Core components done, optional can wait" | No component is optional within a gate. | **Complete ALL components** |

## Gate Order Enforcement (HARD GATE)

**Gates MUST execute in order: 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5. No exceptions.**

| Violation | Why It's WRONG | Consequence |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Skip Gate 1 (DevOps) | "No infra changes" | Code without container = works on my machine only |
| Skip Gate 2 (SRE) | "Observability later" | Blind production = debugging nightmare |
| Reorder Gates | "Review before test" | Reviewing untested code wastes reviewer time |
| Parallel Gates | "Run 2 and 3 together" | Dependencies exist. Order is intentional. |

**Gates are NOT parallelizable across different gates. Sequential execution is MANDATORY.**

## The 6 Gates

| Gate | Skill | Purpose | Agent |
|------|-------|---------|-------|
| 0 | dev-implementation | Write code following TDD | Based on task language/domain |
| 1 | dev-devops | Infrastructure and deployment | devops-engineer |
| 2 | dev-sre | Observability (health, logging, tracing) | sre |
| 3 | dev-testing | Unit tests for acceptance criteria | qa-analyst |
| 4 | dev-review | Parallel code review | code-reviewer, business-logic-reviewer, security-reviewer (3x parallel) |
| 5 | dev-validation | Final acceptance validation | N/A (verification) |

## Integrated PM → Dev Workflow

**PM Team Output** → **Dev Team Execution** (`/dev-cycle`)

| Input Type | Path | Structure |
|------------|------|-----------|
| **Tasks only** | `docs/pre-dev/{feature}/tasks.md` | T-001, T-002, T-003 with requirements + acceptance criteria |
| **Tasks + Subtasks** | `docs/pre-dev/{feature}/` | tasks.md + `subtasks/{task-id}/ST-XXX-01.md, ST-XXX-02.md...` |

## Execution Order

**Core Principle:** Each execution unit (task OR subtask) passes through **all 6 gates** before the next unit.

**Flow:** Unit → Gate 0-5 → 🔒 Unit Checkpoint (Step 7.1) → 🔒 Task Checkpoint (Step 7.2) → Next Unit

| Scenario | Execution Unit | Gates Per Unit |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Task without subtasks | Task itself | 6 gates |
| Task with subtasks | Each subtask | 6 gates per subtask |

## State Management

## ⛔ State Persistence Rule (MANDATORY)

**"Update state" means BOTH update the object AND write to file. Not just in-memory.**

### After EVERY Gate Transition

You MUST execute these steps after completing ANY gate (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5):

```yaml
# Step 1: Update state object with gate results
state.tasks[current_task_index].gate_progress.[gate_name].status = "completed"
state.tasks[current_task_index].gate_progress.[gate_name].completed_at = "[ISO timestamp]"
state.current_gate = [next_gate_number]
state.updated_at = "[ISO timestamp]"

# Step 2: Write to file (MANDATORY - use Write tool)
Write tool:
  file_path: "docs/refactor/current-cycle.json"
  content: [full JSON state]

# Step 3: Verify persistence (MANDATORY - use Read tool)
Read tool:
  file_path: "docs/refactor/current-cycle.json"
# Confirm current_gate and gate_progress match expected values
```

### State Persistence Checkpoints

| After | MUST Update | MUST Write File |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| Gate 0.1 (TDD-RED) | `tdd_red.status`, `tdd_red.failure_output` | ✅ YES |
| Gate 0.2 (TDD-GREEN) | `tdd_green.status`, `implementation.status` | ✅ YES |
| Gate 1 (DevOps) | `devops.status`, `agent_outputs.devops` | ✅ YES |
| Gate 2 (SRE) | `sre.status`, `agent_outputs.sre` | ✅ YES |
| Gate 3 (Testing) | `testing.status`, `agent_outputs.testing` | ✅ YES |
| Gate 4 (Review) | `review.status`, `agent_outputs.review` | ✅ YES |
| Gate 5 (Validation) | `validation.status`, task `status` | ✅ YES |
| Step 7.1 (Unit Approval) | `status = "paused_for_approval"` | ✅ YES |
| Step 7.2 (Task Approval) | `status = "paused_for_task_approval"` | ✅ YES |

### Anti-Rationalization for State Persistence

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "I'll save state at the end" | Crash/timeout loses ALL progress | **Save after EACH gate** |
| "State is in memory, that's updated" | Memory is volatile. File is persistent. | **Write to JSON file** |
| "Only save on checkpoints" | Gates without saves = unrecoverable on resume | **Save after EVERY gate** |
| "Write tool is slow" | Write takes <100ms. Lost progress takes hours. | **Write after EVERY gate** |
| "I updated the state variable" | Variable ≠ file. Without Write tool, nothing persists. | **Use Write tool explicitly** |

### Verification Command

After each gate, the state file MUST reflect:
- `current_gate` = next gate number
- `updated_at` = recent timestamp
- Previous gate `status` = "completed"

**If verification fails → State was not persisted. Re-execute Write tool.**

## Step 0: Verify PROJECT_RULES.md Exists (HARD GATE)

**NON-NEGOTIABLE. Cycle CANNOT proceed without project standards.**

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Question

"Is this a legacy project (created without PM team workflow)?"

#### Options

(a) Yes, this is a legacy project (b) No, this is a new project following Ring workflow

#### If YES (legacy)

Go to Step 0.2.1 (Legacy Project Analysis)

#### If NO (new project)

Go to Step 0.3 (Check for PM Documents)

### Step 0.2.1: Legacy Project Analysis (Technical Only)

#### Overview

For legacy projects, analyze codebase for TECHNICAL information only:

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📋 LEGACY PROJECT ANALYSIS                                      │

│ Since this is a legacy project, I'll analyze the codebase       │
│ for TECHNICAL information (not business rules).                 │
│                                                                 │
│ Step 1: Automated analysis (codebase-explorer)                  │
│ Step 2: Ask for project-specific tech not in Ring Standards     │
│ Step 3: Generate PROJECT_RULES.md (deduplicated)                │
│                                                                 │
│ Note: Business rules belong in PRD/product docs, NOT here.      │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Step 0.2.1a: Automated Codebase Analysis (MANDATORY)

**⛔ You MUST use the Task tool to dispatch codebase-explorer. This is NOT implicit.**

#### Dispatch Agent

Dispatch codebase-explorer to analyze the legacy project for TECHNICAL information:

```text
Action: Use Task tool with EXACTLY these parameters:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ⛔ If Task tool NOT used → Analysis does NOT happen → PROJECT_RULES.md INVALID │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

```yaml
# Agent 1: Codebase Explorer - Technical Analysis
Task tool:
  subagent_type: "codebase-explorer"
  model: "opus"
  description: "Analyze legacy project for PROJECT_RULES.md"
  prompt: |
    Analyze this LEGACY codebase to extract technical information for PROJECT_RULES.md.
    
    This is an existing project created without PM documentation.
    Your job is to understand what exists in the code.
    
    **Extract:**
    1. **Project Structure:** Directory layout, module organization
    2. **Technical Stack:** Languages, frameworks, databases, external services
    3. **Architecture Patterns:** Clean Architecture, MVC, microservices, etc.
    4. **Existing Features:** Main modules, endpoints, capabilities
    5. **Internal Libraries:** Shared packages, utilities
    6. **Configuration:** Environment variables, config patterns
    7. **Database:** Schema patterns, migrations, ORM usage
    8. **External Integrations:** APIs consumed, message queues
    
    **Output format:**
    ## Technical Analysis (Legacy Project)
    
    ### Project Overview
    [What this project appears to do based on code analysis]
    
    ### Technical Stack
    - Language: [detected]
    - Framework: [detected]
    - Database: [detected]
    - External Services: [detected]
    
    ### Architecture Patterns
    [Detected patterns]
    
    ### Existing Features
    [List of features/modules found]
    
    ### Project Structure
    [Directory layout explanation]
    
    ### Configuration
    [Env vars, config files found]
    
    ### External Integrations
    [APIs, services detected]

```

**Note:** Business logic analysis is NOT needed for PROJECT_RULES.md. Business rules belong in PRD/product docs, not technical project rules.

#### Verification (MANDATORY)

After agent completes, confirm:
- [ ] `codebase-explorer` returned "## Technical Analysis (Legacy Project)" section
- [ ] Output contains non-empty content for: Tech Stack, External Integrations, Configuration

**If agent failed or returned empty output → Re-dispatch. Cannot proceed without technical analysis.**

#### Step 0.2.1b: Supplementary Questions (Only What Agents Can't Determine)

#### Post-Analysis Questions

After agents complete, ask ONLY what they couldn't determine from code:

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ✓ Codebase Analysis Complete                                    │

│ I've analyzed your codebase. Now I need a few details that      │
│ only you can provide (not visible in the code).                 │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Questions to Ask

Use AskUserQuestion for each:

| # | Question | Why Agents Can't Determine This |
|---|----------|--------------------------------|
| 1 | **What do you need help with?** (Current task/feature/fix) | Future intent, not in code |
| 2 | **Any external APIs or services not visible in code?** (Third-party integrations planned) | Planned integrations, not yet in code |
| 3 | **Any specific technology not in Ring Standards?** (Message broker, cache, etc.) | Project-specific tech not in Ring |

**Note:** Business rules belong in PRD/product docs, NOT in PROJECT_RULES.md.

#### Step 0.2.1c: Generate PROJECT_RULES.md

#### Combine Agent Outputs and User Answers

```yaml
Create tool:
  file_path: "docs/PROJECT_RULES.md"
  content: |
    # Project Rules
    
    > Ring Standards apply automatically. This file documents ONLY what Ring does NOT cover.
    > For error handling, logging, testing, architecture, lib-commons → See Ring Standards (auto-loaded by agents)
    > Generated from legacy project analysis.
    
    ## What Ring Standards Already Cover (DO NOT ADD HERE)
    
    The following are defined in Ring Standards and MUST NOT be duplicated:
    - Error handling patterns (no panic, wrap errors)
    - Logging standards (structured JSON, zerolog/zap)
    - Testing patterns (table-driven tests, mocks)
    - Architecture patterns (Hexagonal, Clean Architecture)
    - Observability (OpenTelemetry, trace correlation)
    - lib-commons usage and patterns
    - API directory structure

#### Ask for Approval

Use AskUserQuestion:
- Question: "PROJECT_RULES.md has been generated. Would you like to review it before proceeding?"
- Options: (a) Proceed (b) Open for editing first

#### After Approval

Proceed to Step 1

### Step 0.3: Check for PM Documents (PRD/TRD/Feature Map)

#### Check for PM Documents

For NEW projects (not legacy), ask about PM documents:

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📋 NEW PROJECT - PM DOCUMENTS CHECK                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                                 │
│ Since this is a new project following Ring workflow, you        │
│ should have PM documents from the pre-dev workflow.             │
│                                                                 │
│ Do you have any of these PM documents?                          │
│   • PRD (Product Requirements Document)                         │
│   • TRD (Technical Requirements Document)                       │
│   • Feature Map (from pre-dev-feature-map skill)                │
│                                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Question

"Do you have PRD, TRD, or Feature Map documents for this project?"

#### Options

(a) Yes, I have PM documents (b) No, I don't have these documents

#### If YES - Ask for File Paths

```text
"Please provide the file path(s) to your PM documents:
 - PRD path (or 'skip' if none): 
 - TRD path (or 'skip' if none): 
 - Feature Map path (or 'skip' if none): "
```

#### Example Paths

Typical PM team output structure:

```text
docs/pre-dev/{feature-name}/
├── prd.md              → PRD path: docs/pre-dev/auth-system/prd.md
├── trd.md              → TRD path: docs/pre-dev/auth-system/trd.md
├── feature-map.md      → Feature Map path: docs/pre-dev/auth-system/feature-map.md
├── api-design.md
├── data-model.md
└── tasks.md
```

#### Common Patterns

- `/pre-dev-full` output: `docs/pre-dev/{feature}/prd.md`, `trd.md`, `feature-map.md`
- `/pre-dev-feature` output: `docs/pre-dev/{feature}/prd.md`, `feature-map.md`
- Custom locations: User may have docs in different paths (e.g., `requirements/`, `specs/`)

#### Then

Go to Step 0.3.1 (Generate from PM Documents)

#### If NO

HARD BLOCK (Step 0.3.2)

### Step 0.3.1: Generate from PM Documents (PRD/TRD/Feature Map)

#### Read the Provided Documents

```yaml
# Read PRD if provided
Read tool:
  file_path: "[user-provided PRD path]"

# Read TRD if provided  
Read tool:
  file_path: "[user-provided TRD path]"

# Read Feature Map if provided
Read tool:
  file_path: "[user-provided Feature Map path]"
```

#### Extract PROJECT_RULES.md Content from PM Documents

**⛔ DEDUPLICATION RULE:** Extract ONLY what Ring Standards do NOT cover.

| From PRD | Extract For PROJECT_RULES.md | Note |
|----------|------------------------------|------|
| Domain terms, entities | Domain Terminology | Technical names only |
| External service mentions | External Integrations | Third-party APIs |
| ~~Business rules~~ | ~~N/A~~ | ❌ Stays in PRD, not PROJECT_RULES |
| ~~Architecture~~ | ~~N/A~~ | ❌ Ring Standards covers this |

| From TRD | Extract For PROJECT_RULES.md | Note |
|----------|------------------------------|------|
| Tech stack not in Ring | Tech Stack (Not in Ring) | Only non-standard tech |
| External APIs | External Integrations | Third-party services |
| Non-standard directories | Non-Standard Directory Structure | Workers, consumers, etc. |
| ~~Architecture decisions~~ | ~~N/A~~ | ❌ Ring Standards covers this |
| ~~Database patterns~~ | ~~N/A~~ | ❌ Ring Standards covers this |

| From Feature Map | Extract For PROJECT_RULES.md | Note |
|------------------|------------------------------|------|
| Technology choices not in Ring | Tech Stack (Not in Ring) | Only if not in Ring |
| External dependencies | External Integrations | Third-party services |
| ~~Architecture~~ | ~~N/A~~ | ❌ Ring Standards covers this |

#### Generate PROJECT_RULES.md

```yaml
Create tool:
  file_path: "docs/PROJECT_RULES.md"
  content: |
    # Project Rules
    
    > ⛔ IMPORTANT: Ring Standards are NOT automatic. Agents MUST WebFetch them before implementation.
    > This file documents ONLY project-specific information not covered by Ring Standards.
    > Generated from PM documents (PRD/TRD/Feature Map).
    >
    > Ring Standards URLs:
    > - Go: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/dev-team/docs/standards/golang.md
    > - TypeScript: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/dev-team/docs/standards/typescript.md
    
    ## What Ring Standards Cover (DO NOT DUPLICATE HERE)
    
    The following are defined in Ring Standards and MUST NOT be duplicated in this file:
    - Error handling patterns (no panic, wrap errors)
    - Logging standards (structured JSON via lib-commons)
    - Testing patterns (table-driven tests, mocks)
    - Architecture patterns (Hexagonal, Clean Architecture)
    - Observability (OpenTelemetry via lib-commons)
    - lib-commons / lib-common-js usage and patterns
    - API directory structure (Core one pattern)
    - Database connections (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis via lib-commons)
    - Bootstrap pattern (config.go, service.go, server.go)
    
    **Agents MUST WebFetch Ring Standards and output Standards Coverage Table.**

```

#### Check for Missing Information

If any section is empty or incomplete, ask supplementary questions:

| Missing Section | Supplementary Question |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Tech Stack (Not in Ring) | "Any technology not covered by Ring Standards (message broker, cache, etc.)?" |
| External Integrations | "Any third-party APIs or external services?" |
| Domain Terminology | "What are the main entities/classes in this codebase?" |
| Non-Standard Directories | "Any directories that don't follow standard API structure (workers, consumers)?" |

**Note:** Do NOT ask about architecture, error handling, logging, testing - Ring Standards covers these.

#### After Generation

Present to user for review, then proceed to Step 1.

### Step 0.3.2: HARD BLOCK - No PM Documents (New Projects Only)

#### Action

STOP EXECUTION. Do NOT proceed to Step 1.

### Step 0 Anti-Rationalization

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Skip PM docs, I'll add them later" | Later = never. No PM docs = no project context = agents guessing. | **Run /pre-dev-full or /pre-dev-feature NOW** |
| "Project is simple, doesn't need PM docs" | Simple projects still need domain context defined upfront. | **Create PM documents first** |
| "I know what I want to build" | Your knowledge ≠ documented knowledge agents can use. | **Document in PRD/TRD/Feature Map** |
| "PM workflow takes too long" | PM workflow takes 30-60 min. Rework from unclear requirements takes days. | **Invest time upfront** |
| "Just let me start coding" | Coding without requirements = building the wrong thing. | **Requirements first, code second** |
| "It's legacy but I don't want to answer questions" | Legacy analysis takes ~5 min. Without it, agents have zero context. | **Answer the 4 questions** |
| "Legacy project is too complex to explain" | Start with high-level answers. PROJECT_RULES.md can be refined later. | **Provide what you know NOW** |

### Pressure Resistance

| User Says | Your Response |
|-----------|---------------|
| "Just skip this, I'll create PM docs later" | "PM documents are REQUIRED for new projects. Without them, agents cannot understand your project's domain context or technical requirements. Run `/pre-dev-full` or `/pre-dev-feature` first." |
| "I don't need formal documents" | "PM documents are the source of truth for PROJECT_RULES.md. Development cannot start without documented requirements." |
| "This is just a quick prototype" | "Even prototypes need clear requirements. `/pre-dev-feature` takes ~30 minutes and prevents hours of rework." |
| "I already explained what I want verbally" | "Verbal explanations cannot be used by agents. Requirements MUST be documented in PRD/TRD/Feature Map files." |
| "It's a legacy project but skip the questions" | "The legacy analysis (codebase-explorer + 3 questions) is the only way I can understand your project. It takes ~5 minutes and enables me to help you effectively." |
| "I'll fill in PROJECT_RULES.md myself" | "That works! Create `docs/PROJECT_RULES.md` with: Tech Stack (not in Ring), External Integrations, Domain Terminology. Do NOT duplicate Ring Standards content. Then run `/dev-cycle` again." |

---

## Step 1: Initialize or Resume

### New Cycle (with task file path)

**Input:** `path/to/tasks.md` OR `path/to/pre-dev/{feature}/`

1. **Detect input:** File → Load directly | Directory → Load tasks.md + discover subtasks/
2. **Build order:** Read tasks, check for subtasks (ST-XXX-01, 02...) or TDD autonomous mode
3. **Initialize state:** Generate cycle_id, create `docs/refactor/current-cycle.json`, set indices to 0
4. **Display plan:** "Loaded X tasks with Y subtasks"
5. **ASK EXECUTION MODE (MANDATORY - AskUserQuestion):**
   - Options: (a) Manual per subtask (b) Manual per task (c) Automatic
   - **Do NOT skip:** User hints ≠ mode selection. Only explicit a/b/c is valid.
6. **Start:** Display mode, proceed to Gate 0

### Resume Cycle (--resume flag)

1. Load `docs/refactor/current-cycle.json`, validate
2. Display: cycle started, tasks completed/total, current task/subtask/gate, paused reason
3. **Handle paused states:**

| Status | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `paused_for_approval` | Re-present Step 7.1 checkpoint |
| `paused_for_testing` | Ask if testing complete → continue or keep paused |
| `paused_for_task_approval` | Re-present Step 7.2 checkpoint |
| `paused_for_integration_testing` | Ask if integration testing complete |
| `paused` (generic) | Ask user to confirm resume |
| `in_progress` | Resume from current gate |

## Input Validation

Task files are generated by `/pre-dev-*` or `/dev-refactor`, which handle content validation. The dev-cycle performs basic format checks:

### Format Checks

| Check | Validation | Action |
|-------|------------|--------|
| File exists | Task file path is readable | Error: abort |
| Task headers | At least one `## Task:` found | Error: abort |
| Task ID format | `## Task: {ID} - {Title}` | Warning: use line number as ID |
| Acceptance criteria | At least one `- [ ]` per task | Warning: task may fail validation gate |

## Step 2: Gate 0 - Implementation (Per Execution Unit)

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use dev-implementation

**Execution Unit:** Task (if no subtasks) OR Subtask (if task has subtasks)

### ⛔ MANDATORY: Agent Dispatch Required

See [shared-patterns/shared-orchestrator-principle.md](../shared-patterns/shared-orchestrator-principle.md) for full details.

**Gate 0 has TWO explicit sub-phases with a HARD GATE between them:**

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│  ──────────────────                                             │
│  Implement minimal code → Run test → Verify PASS                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 2.1: Gate 0.1 - TDD-RED (Write Failing Test)

1. Record gate start timestamp
2. Set `gate_progress.implementation.tdd_red.status = "in_progress"`

3. Determine appropriate agent based on content:
   - Go files/go.mod → backend-engineer-golang
   - TypeScript backend → backend-engineer-typescript
   - React/Frontend → frontend-engineer-typescript
   - Infrastructure → devops-engineer

4. Dispatch to selected agent for TDD-RED ONLY:

   See [shared-patterns/template-tdd-prompts.md](../shared-patterns/template-tdd-prompts.md) for the TDD-RED prompt template.

   Include: unit_id, title, requirements, acceptance_criteria in the prompt.

5. Receive TDD-RED report from agent
6. **VERIFY FAILURE OUTPUT EXISTS (HARD GATE):** See shared-patterns/template-tdd-prompts.md for verification rules.

7. Update state:
   ```json
   gate_progress.implementation.tdd_red = {
     "status": "completed",
     "test_file": "[path from agent]",
     "failure_output": "[actual failure output from agent]",
     "completed_at": "[ISO timestamp]"
   }
   ```

8. **Display to user:**
   ```text
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ ✓ TDD-RED COMPLETE                              │
   ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
   │ Test: [test_file]:[test_function]               │
   │ Failure: [first line of failure output]         │
   │                                                 │
   │ Proceeding to TDD-GREEN...                      │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   ```

9. Proceed to Gate 0.2

### Step 2.2: Gate 0.2 - TDD-GREEN (Implementation)

**PREREQUISITE:** `gate_progress.implementation.tdd_red.status == "completed"`

1. Set `gate_progress.implementation.tdd_green.status = "in_progress"`

2. Dispatch to same agent for TDD-GREEN:

   See [shared-patterns/template-tdd-prompts.md](../shared-patterns/template-tdd-prompts.md) for the TDD-GREEN prompt template (includes observability requirements).

   Include: unit_id, title, tdd_red.test_file, tdd_red.failure_output in the prompt.

3. Receive TDD-GREEN report from agent
4. **VERIFY PASS OUTPUT EXISTS (HARD GATE):** See shared-patterns/template-tdd-prompts.md for verification rules.

5. Update state:
   ```json
   gate_progress.implementation.tdd_green = {
     "status": "completed",
     "implementation_file": "[path from agent]",
     "test_pass_output": "[actual pass output from agent]",
     "completed_at": "[ISO timestamp]"
   }
   gate_progress.implementation.status = "completed"
   artifacts.implementation = {files_changed, commit_sha}
   agent_outputs.implementation = {
     agent: "[selected_agent]",
     output: "[full agent output for feedback analysis]",
     timestamp: "[ISO timestamp]",
     duration_ms: [execution time]
   }
   ```

6. **Display to user:**
   ```text
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ ✓ GATE 0 COMPLETE (TDD-RED → TDD-GREEN)        │
   ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
   │ RED:   [test_file] - FAIL captured ✓           │
   │ GREEN: [impl_file] - PASS verified ✓           │
   │                                                 │
   │ Proceeding to Gate 1 (DevOps)...               │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   ```

7. **Proceed to Step 2.3 (Standards Compliance Verification)**

### Step 2.3: Standards Compliance Verification (HARD GATE)

**PREREQUISITE:** `gate_progress.implementation.tdd_green.status == "completed"`

**Purpose:** Verify implementation follows ALL standards defined in agent's standards file.

See [shared-patterns/template-tdd-prompts.md](../shared-patterns/template-tdd-prompts.md) → "Orchestrator Enforcement" section for full verification process.

**Process:**

### Step 2.3.1: Initialize Iteration Counter

```text
Set standards_compliance_iterations = 0
Set MAX_ITERATIONS = 3
```

### Step 2.3.2: Verification Loop

```text
LOOP while standards_compliance_iterations < MAX_ITERATIONS:
  
  1. INCREMENT counter FIRST (before any verification):
     standards_compliance_iterations += 1
  
  2. PARSE agent output for "## Standards Coverage Table":
     IF NOT FOUND:
       → Output INCOMPLETE
       → Log: "Iteration [N]: Standards Coverage Table missing"
       → Re-dispatch agent (see Step 2.3.3)
       → CONTINUE loop
  
  3. PARSE "ALL STANDARDS MET:" value:
     IF NOT FOUND:
       → Output INCOMPLETE
       → Log: "Iteration [N]: Compliance Summary missing"
       → Re-dispatch agent (see Step 2.3.3)
       → CONTINUE loop
  
  4. COUNT sections from Standards Coverage Table:
     total_sections = count all rows
     compliant = count rows with ✅
     not_applicable = count rows with N/A
     non_compliant = count rows with ❌
  
  5. VERIFY compliance:
     IF "ALL STANDARDS MET: ✅ YES" AND non_compliant == 0:
       → Gate 0 PASSED
       → BREAK loop (proceed to Step 2.3.4)
     
     IF "ALL STANDARDS MET: ❌ NO" OR non_compliant > 0:
       → Gate 0 BLOCKED
       → Extract ❌ sections
       → Log: "Iteration [N]: [non_compliant] sections non-compliant"
       → Re-dispatch agent (see Step 2.3.3)
       → CONTINUE loop

END LOOP

IF standards_compliance_iterations >= MAX_ITERATIONS AND non_compliant > 0:
  → HARD BLOCK
  → Update state with failure info
  → Report to user: "Standards compliance failed after 3 attempts"
  → STOP execution
```

### Step 2.3.3: Re-dispatch Agent for Compliance Fix

```yaml
Task tool:
  subagent_type: "[same agent from TDD-GREEN]"
  model: "opus"
  description: "Fix missing Ring Standards for [unit_id] (attempt [N]/3)"
  prompt: |
    ⛔ STANDARDS NOT MET - Fix Required (Attempt [standards_compliance_iterations] of 3)
    
    Your Standards Coverage Table shows these sections as ❌:
    [list ❌ sections extracted from table]
    
    WebFetch your standards file:
    [URL for agent's standards - golang.md, typescript.md, etc.]
    
    Implement ALL missing sections.
    Return updated Standards Coverage Table with ALL ✅ or N/A.
    
    Previous attempt summary:
    - Total sections: [total_sections]
    - Compliant: [compliant]
    - Not applicable: [not_applicable]
    - Non-compliant: [non_compliant]
```

### Step 2.3.4: Update State with Compliance Metrics

```json
gate_progress.implementation = {
  "status": "completed",
  "tdd_red": {...},
  "tdd_green": {...},
  "standards_verified": true,
  "standards_compliance_iterations": [final count - e.g., 1, 2, or 3],
  "standards_coverage": {
    "total_sections": [N - from final successful verification],
    "compliant": [N - sections with ✅],
    "not_applicable": [N - sections with N/A],
    "non_compliant": 0
  }
}
```

**Note:** `non_compliant` MUST be 0 when gate passes. If non-zero after 3 iterations, gate is BLOCKED.

5. **Display to user:**
   ```text
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ ✓ GATE 0 COMPLETE                              │
   ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
   │ TDD-RED:   [test_file] - FAIL captured ✓       │
   │ TDD-GREEN: [impl_file] - PASS verified ✓       │
   │ STANDARDS: [N]/[N] sections compliant ✓        │
   │ ITERATIONS: [standards_compliance_iterations]   │
   │                                                 │
   │ Proceeding to Gate 1 (DevOps)...               │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   ```

6. **⛔ SAVE STATE TO FILE (MANDATORY):**
   ```yaml
   Write tool:
     file_path: "docs/refactor/current-cycle.json"
     content: [full updated state JSON]
   ```
   See "State Persistence Rule" section. State MUST be written to file after Gate 0.

7. **Proceed to Gate 1**

### Standards Compliance Anti-Rationalization

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Agent said implementation is complete" | Agent completion ≠ Standards compliance. Verify table. | **Parse and verify Standards Coverage Table** |
| "Table wasn't in agent output" | Missing table = Incomplete output = Re-dispatch | **Re-dispatch agent to output table** |
| "Only 1-2 sections are ❌" | ANY ❌ = BLOCKED. Count is irrelevant. | **Re-dispatch to fix ALL ❌ sections** |
| "lib-commons is the main thing" | ALL sections are equally required. No prioritization. | **Verify ALL sections from standards-coverage-table.md** |
| "Agent knows the standards" | Knowledge ≠ implementation. Evidence required. | **Check file:line evidence in table** |
| "Standards verification is slow" | Verification prevents rework. 30 seconds vs hours. | **Always verify before proceeding** |

### TDD Sub-Phase Anti-Rationalization

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Test passes on first run, skip RED" | Passing test ≠ TDD. Test MUST fail first. | **Delete test, rewrite to fail first** |
| "I'll capture failure output later" | Later = never. Failure output is the gate. | **Capture NOW or cannot proceed** |
| "Failure output is in the logs somewhere" | "Somewhere" ≠ captured. Must be in state. | **Extract and store in tdd_red.failure_output** |
| "GREEN passed, RED doesn't matter now" | RED proves test validity. Skip = invalid test. | **Re-run RED phase, capture failure** |
| "Agent already did TDD internally" | Internal ≠ verified. State must show evidence. | **Agent must output failure explicitly** |

## Step 3: Gate 1 - DevOps (Per Execution Unit)

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use dev-devops

### ⛔ HARD GATE: Required Artifacts MUST Be Created

**Gate 1 is a BLOCKING gate.** DevOps agent MUST create ALL required artifacts. If ANY artifact is missing:
- You CANNOT proceed to Gate 2
- You MUST re-dispatch to devops-engineer to create missing artifacts
- You MUST verify ALL artifacts exist before proceeding

### Required Artifacts

**See [shared-patterns/standards-coverage-table.md](../skills/shared-patterns/standards-coverage-table.md) → "devops-engineer → devops.md" for ALL required sections.**

**Key artifacts from devops.md:**
- Containers (Dockerfile + Docker Compose)
- Makefile Standards (ALL required commands)
- Infrastructure as Code (if applicable)
- Helm charts (if K8s deployment)

### Step 3.1: Dispatch DevOps Agent

```text
For current execution unit:

1. Record gate start timestamp
2. Dispatch DevOps agent (ALWAYS - not optional):

   Task tool:
     subagent_type: "devops-engineer"
     model: "opus"
     description: "Create/update DevOps artifacts for [unit_id]"
     prompt: |
       ⛔ MANDATORY: Create ALL DevOps Artifacts for: [unit_id]

       ## Implementation Summary from Gate 0:
       [implementation_artifacts]

       ## Standards Reference:
       WebFetch: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/dev-team/docs/standards/devops.md
       
       You MUST implement ALL sections from devops.md. See standards-coverage-table.md
       for the complete list: devops-engineer → devops.md

       ## Required Output:

       ### Standards Coverage Table
       | # | Section (from devops.md) | Status | Evidence |
       |---|--------------------------|--------|----------|
       | 1 | Containers | ✅/❌ | Dockerfile:[line], docker-compose.yml:[line] |
       | 2 | Makefile Standards | ✅/❌ | Makefile:[line] |
       | ... | ... | ... | ... |

       ### Compliance Summary
       - **ALL STANDARDS MET:** ✅ YES / ❌ NO
       - **If NO, what's missing:** [list sections]

       ### Verification Commands Executed:
       - `docker build -t [service] .` → [result]
       - `docker-compose config` → [result]
       - `make` → [result]

3. Parse agent output and verify Standards Coverage Table
```

### Step 3.2: Verify Standards Coverage Table (HARD GATE)

```text
4. Parse agent output for Standards Coverage Table:

   IF "ALL STANDARDS MET: ✅ YES" AND all sections have ✅ or N/A:
     → Verify files actually exist (Read tool for each artifact)
     → If all files exist → Gate 1 PASSED. Proceed to Step 3.3.

   IF ANY section has ❌:
     → Gate 1 BLOCKED. Standards not met.
     → Extract ❌ sections from Standards Coverage Table
     → Re-dispatch to devops-engineer:

     Task tool:
       subagent_type: "devops-engineer"
       model: "opus"
       description: "Fix missing DevOps standards for [unit_id]"
       prompt: |
         ⛔ FIX REQUIRED - DevOps Standards Not Met

         Your Standards Coverage Table shows these sections as ❌:
         [list ❌ sections from table]

         WebFetch the standards again:
         https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LerianStudio/ring/main/dev-team/docs/standards/devops.md

         Implement ALL missing sections.
         Return updated Standards Coverage Table with ALL ✅ or N/A.

     → After fix: Re-verify Standards Coverage Table
     → Max 3 iterations, then STOP and escalate to user
```

### Step 3.3: Gate 1 Complete

```text
5. When all artifacts verified:
   - agent_outputs.devops = {
       agent: "devops-engineer",
       output: "[full agent output]",
       artifacts_created: ["Dockerfile", "docker-compose.yml", ".env.example", "Makefile"],
       timestamp: "[ISO timestamp]",
       duration_ms: [execution time]
     }

6. Update state:
   - gate_progress.devops.status = "completed"
   - gate_progress.devops.artifacts = [list of created files]

7. **⛔ SAVE STATE TO FILE (MANDATORY):**
   Write tool → "docs/refactor/current-cycle.json"

8. Proceed to Gate 2
```

### Gate 1 Anti-Rationalization Table

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Dockerfile exists, skip other artifacts" | ALL artifacts required. 1/4 ≠ complete. | **Create ALL artifacts** |
| "docker-compose not needed locally" | docker-compose is MANDATORY for local dev. | **Create docker-compose.yml** |
| "Makefile is optional" | Makefile is MANDATORY for standardized commands. | **Create Makefile** |
| ".env.example can be added later" | .env.example documents required config NOW. | **Create .env.example** |
| "Small service doesn't need all this" | Size is irrelevant. Standards apply uniformly. | **Create ALL artifacts** |

## Step 4: Gate 2 - SRE (Per Execution Unit)

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use `dev-sre`

### Step 4.1: Prepare Input for dev-sre Skill

```text
Gather from previous gates:

sre_input = {
  // REQUIRED - from current execution unit
  unit_id: state.current_unit.id,
  
  // REQUIRED - from Gate 0 context
  language: state.current_unit.language,  // "go" | "typescript" | "python"
  service_type: state.current_unit.service_type,  // "api" | "worker" | "batch" | "cli"
  implementation_agent: agent_outputs.implementation.agent,  // e.g., "backend-engineer-golang"
  implementation_files: agent_outputs.implementation.files_changed,  // list of files from Gate 0
  
  // OPTIONAL - additional context
  external_dependencies: state.current_unit.external_deps || [],  // HTTP clients, gRPC, queues
  gate0_handoff: agent_outputs.implementation,  // full Gate 0 output
  gate1_handoff: agent_outputs.devops  // full Gate 1 output
}
```

### Step 4.2: Invoke dev-sre Skill

```text
1. Record gate start timestamp

2. Invoke dev-sre skill with structured input:

   Skill("dev-sre") with input:
     unit_id: sre_input.unit_id
     language: sre_input.language
     service_type: sre_input.service_type
     implementation_agent: sre_input.implementation_agent
     implementation_files: sre_input.implementation_files
     external_dependencies: sre_input.external_dependencies
     gate0_handoff: sre_input.gate0_handoff
     gate1_handoff: sre_input.gate1_handoff

   The skill handles:
   - Dispatching SRE agent for validation
   - Structured logging validation
   - Distributed tracing validation
   - Code instrumentation coverage (90%+ required)
   - Context propagation validation (InjectHTTPContext/InjectGRPCContext)
   - Dispatching fixes to implementation agent if needed
   - Re-validation loop (max 3 iterations)

3. Parse skill output for validation results:
   
   Expected output sections:
   - "## Validation Result" → status, iterations, coverage
   - "## Instrumentation Coverage" → table with per-layer coverage
   - "## Issues Found" → list or "None"
   - "## Handoff to Next Gate" → ready_for_testing: YES/NO
   
   IF skill output contains "Status: PASS" AND "Ready for Gate 3: YES":
     → Gate 2 PASSED. Proceed to Step 4.3.
   
   IF skill output contains "Status: FAIL" OR "Ready for Gate 3: NO":
     → Gate 2 BLOCKED. 
     → Skill already dispatched fixes to implementation agent
     → Skill already re-ran validation
     → If "ESCALATION" in output: STOP and report to user

4. **⛔ SAVE STATE TO FILE (MANDATORY):**
   Write tool → "docs/refactor/current-cycle.json"
```

### Step 4.3: Gate 2 Complete

```text
5. When dev-sre skill returns PASS:
   
   Parse from skill output:
   - status: extract from "## Validation Result"
   - instrumentation_coverage: extract percentage from coverage table
   - iterations: extract from "Iterations:" line
   
   - agent_outputs.sre = {
       skill: "dev-sre",
       output: "[full skill output]",
       validation_result: "PASS",
       instrumentation_coverage: "[X%]",
       iterations: [count],
       timestamp: "[ISO timestamp]",
       duration_ms: [execution time]
     }

6. Update state:
   - gate_progress.sre.status = "completed"
   - gate_progress.sre.observability_validated = true
   - gate_progress.sre.instrumentation_coverage = "[X%]"

7. Proceed to Gate 3
```

### Gate 2 Anti-Rationalization Table

See [dev-sre/SKILL.md](../dev-sre/SKILL.md) for complete anti-rationalization tables covering:
- Observability deferral rationalizations
- Instrumentation coverage rationalizations
- Context propagation rationalizations

### Gate 2 Pressure Resistance

| User Says | Your Response |
|-----------|---------------|
| "Skip SRE validation, we'll add observability later" | "Observability is MANDATORY for Gate 2. Invoking dev-sre skill now." |
| "SRE found issues but let's continue" | "Gate 2 is a HARD GATE. dev-sre skill handles fix dispatch and re-validation." |
| "Instrumentation coverage is low but code works" | "90%+ instrumentation coverage is REQUIRED. dev-sre skill will not pass until met." |

## Step 5: Gate 3 - Testing (Per Execution Unit)

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use dev-testing

### Simple Flow

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  QA runs tests → checks coverage against threshold      │
│                                                         │
│  PASS (coverage ≥ threshold) → Proceed to Gate 4       │
│  FAIL (coverage < threshold) → Return to Gate 0        │
│                                                         │
│  Max 3 attempts, then escalate to user                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Threshold

- Default: **85%** (Ring minimum)
- Can be higher if defined in `docs/PROJECT_RULES.md`
- Cannot be lower than 85%

### Execution

```text
1. Dispatch QA analyst with acceptance criteria and threshold
2. QA writes tests, runs them, checks coverage
3. QA returns VERDICT: PASS or FAIL

   PASS → Proceed to Gate 4 (Review)

   FAIL → Return to Gate 0 (Implementation) to add tests
          QA provides: what lines/branches need coverage

4. Track iteration count (state.testing.iteration)
   - Max 3 iterations allowed
   - After 3rd failure: STOP and escalate to user
   - Do NOT attempt 4th iteration automatically

5. **⛔ SAVE STATE TO FILE (MANDATORY):**
   Write tool → "docs/refactor/current-cycle.json"
   See "State Persistence Rule" section.
```

### State Tracking

```json
{
  "testing": {
    "verdict": "PASS|FAIL",
    "coverage_actual": 87.5,
    "coverage_threshold": 85,
    "iteration": 1
  }
}
```

## Step 6: Gate 4 - Review (Per Execution Unit)

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use requesting-code-review

### ⛔ HARD GATE: Issues MUST Be Fixed Before Proceeding

**Gate 4 is a BLOCKING gate.** If reviewers find CRITICAL, HIGH, or MEDIUM severity issues:
- You CANNOT proceed to Gate 5
- You MUST dispatch fixes to the appropriate agent
- You MUST re-run ALL 3 reviewers after fixes
- You MUST repeat until ALL issues are resolved or max iterations reached

### Step 6.1: Initial Review Dispatch

```text
For current execution unit:

1. Record gate start timestamp
2. Dispatch all 3 reviewers in parallel (single message, 3 Task calls):

   Task tool #1:
     subagent_type: "code-reviewer"
     model: "opus"
     prompt: |
       Review implementation for: [unit_id]
       BASE_SHA: [pre-implementation commit]
       HEAD_SHA: [current commit]
       REQUIREMENTS: [unit requirements]

   Task tool #2:
     subagent_type: "business-logic-reviewer"
     model: "opus"
     prompt: [same structure]

   Task tool #3:
     subagent_type: "security-reviewer"
     model: "opus"
     prompt: [same structure]

3. Wait for all reviewers to complete
4. Store all reviewer outputs:
   - agent_outputs.review = {
       code_reviewer: {
         agent: "code-reviewer",
         output: "[full output for feedback analysis]",
         verdict: "PASS|FAIL",
         issues: [{severity, description, file, line}],
         timestamp: "[ISO timestamp]"
       },
       business_logic_reviewer: {
         agent: "business-logic-reviewer",
         output: "[full output for feedback analysis]",
         verdict: "PASS|FAIL",
         issues: [{severity, description, file, line}],
         timestamp: "[ISO timestamp]"
       },
       security_reviewer: {
         agent: "security-reviewer",
         output: "[full output for feedback analysis]",
         verdict: "PASS|FAIL",
         issues: [{severity, description, file, line}],
         timestamp: "[ISO timestamp]"
       }
     }
```

### Step 6.2: Aggregate and Classify Issues

```text
5. Parse all reviewer outputs and aggregate issues by severity:

   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION                                         │
   ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
   │ CRITICAL: Security vulnerabilities, data loss, crashes          │
   │           → MUST FIX. Cannot proceed. Auto-dispatch to agent.   │
   │                                                                 │
   │ HIGH:     Major bugs, incorrect business logic, performance     │
   │           → MUST FIX. Cannot proceed. Auto-dispatch to agent.   │
   │                                                                 │
   │ MEDIUM:   Code quality, standards violations, edge cases        │
   │           → MUST FIX. Cannot proceed. Auto-dispatch to agent.   │
   │                                                                 │
   │ LOW:      Best practices, minor improvements                    │
   │           → Add TODO(review): comment. Can proceed.             │
   │                                                                 │
   │ COSMETIC: Style, formatting, naming nitpicks                    │
   │           → Add FIXME(nitpick): comment. Can proceed.           │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

6. Create aggregated issue list:
   aggregated_issues = {
     blocking: [  // CRITICAL + HIGH + MEDIUM
       {severity, reviewer, description, file, line, suggested_fix}
     ],
     non_blocking: [  // LOW + COSMETIC
       {severity, reviewer, description, file, line}
     ]
   }
```

### Step 6.3: Handle Non-Blocking Issues (LOW/COSMETIC)

```text
7. For each non-blocking issue, add inline comments:

   LOW severity → Add TODO comment:
   // TODO(review): [description] - [reviewer] on [date]

   COSMETIC severity → Add FIXME comment:
   // FIXME(nitpick): [description] - [reviewer] on [date]

   These comments are added but DO NOT block progression.
```

### Step 6.4: Handle Blocking Issues (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM) - HARD GATE

```text
8. IF aggregated_issues.blocking is NOT empty:

   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ ⛔ GATE 4 BLOCKED - ISSUES MUST BE FIXED                        │

   │                                                                 │
   │ Found N blocking issues:                                        │
   │   • CRITICAL: X issues                                          │
   │   • HIGH: Y issues                                               │
   │   • MEDIUM: Z issues                                            │
   │                                                                 │
   │ Dispatching fixes to appropriate agents...                      │
   │                                                                 │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

   a) Group issues by responsible agent (based on issue type):

   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ ISSUE-TO-AGENT ROUTING                                         │

   b) Dispatch fix request to each responsible agent:

   Task tool:
     subagent_type: "[agent from routing table]"
     model: "opus"
     description: "Fix review issues for [unit_id]"
     prompt: |
       ⛔ FIX REQUIRED - Review Issues Found

       You MUST fix the following issues identified by code reviewers.
       Do NOT skip any issue. Do NOT defer any issue.

       ## Context
       - Unit ID: [unit_id]
       - Unit Title: [title]
       - Files Changed: [list of files from implementation]

       ## Issues to Fix (BLOCKING - ALL MUST BE RESOLVED)

       [For each issue assigned to this agent:]
       ### Issue N: [severity] - [reviewer]
       - **Description:** [description]
       - **File:** [file]:[line]
       - **Suggested Fix:** [suggested_fix if provided]

       ## Requirements
       1. Fix ALL issues listed above
       2. Run tests after fixes to ensure no regressions
       3. Report what was fixed and how

       ## Output Format
       For each issue:
       - Issue: [description]
       - Fix Applied: [what you did]
       - File Changed: [file]:[lines]
       - Test Verification: [test results]

   c) Wait for all fix agents to complete

   d) Store fix results in state:
      agent_outputs.review.fix_iteration_N = {
        issues_fixed: N,
        agents_dispatched: [list],
        timestamp: "[ISO timestamp]"
      }
```

### Step 6.5: Re-Run ALL Reviewers After Fixes

```text
9. After ALL fixes are applied:

   ⛔ MANDATORY: Re-run ALL 3 reviewers in parallel
   (You CANNOT cherry-pick reviewers. ALL 3 must re-run.)

   Increment: metrics.review_iterations += 1

   Dispatch all 3 reviewers again (same as Step 6.1)
   with updated HEAD_SHA reflecting the fixes.

10. Parse results and check for remaining blocking issues:

    IF aggregated_issues.blocking is empty:
      → Gate 4 PASSED. Proceed to Step 6.6.

    IF aggregated_issues.blocking is NOT empty:
      → Check iteration count

11. Iteration limit check:

    IF metrics.review_iterations >= 3:

      Set gate_progress.review.status = "failed"
      Set gate_progress.review.blocked_reason = "max_iterations"
      Save state
      STOP execution - require user decision

    IF metrics.review_iterations < 3:

### Gate 4 Anti-Rationalization Table

| Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "Only 1 MEDIUM issue, can proceed" | MEDIUM = MUST FIX. Quantity is irrelevant. | **Fix the issue, re-run all reviewers** |
| "Issue is cosmetic, not really MEDIUM" | Reviewer decided severity. Accept their judgment. | **Fix the issue, re-run all reviewers** |
| "Will fix in next sprint" | Deferred fixes = technical debt = production bugs. | **Fix NOW before Gate 5** |
| "User approved, can skip fix" | User approval ≠ reviewer override. Fixes are mandatory. | **Fix the issue, re-run all reviewers** |
| "Same issue keeps appearing, skip it" | Recurring issue = fix is wrong. Debug properly. | **Root cause analysis, then fix** |
| "Only security reviewer found it" | One reviewer = valid finding. All findings matter. | **Fix the issue, re-run all reviewers** |
| "Iteration limit reached, just proceed" | Limit = escalate, not bypass. Quality is non-negotiable. | **Escalate to user, do NOT proceed** |
| "Tests pass, review issues don't matter" | Tests ≠ review. Different quality dimensions. | **Fix the issue, re-run all reviewers** |

### Gate 4 Pressure Resistance

| User Says | Your Response |
|-----------|---------------|
| "Just skip this MEDIUM issue" | "MEDIUM severity issues are blocking by definition. I MUST dispatch a fix to the appropriate agent before proceeding. This protects code quality." |
| "I'll fix it later, let's continue" | "Gate 4 is a HARD GATE. All CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM issues must be resolved NOW. I'm dispatching the fix to [agent] and will re-run reviewers after." |
| "We're running out of time" | "Proceeding with known issues creates larger problems later. The fix dispatch is automated and typically takes 2-5 minutes. Quality gates exist to save time overall." |
| "Override the gate, I approve" | "User approval cannot override reviewer findings. The gate ensures code quality. I'll dispatch the fix now." |
| "It's just a style issue" | "If it's truly cosmetic, reviewers would mark it COSMETIC (non-blocking). MEDIUM means it affects maintainability or correctness. Fixing now." |

## Step 7: Gate 5 - Validation (Per Execution Unit)

```text
For current execution unit:

1. Record gate start timestamp
2. Verify acceptance criteria:
   For each criterion in acceptance_criteria:
     - Check if implemented
     - Check if tested
     - Mark as PASS/FAIL

3. Run final verification:
   - All tests pass?
   - No Critical/High/Medium review issues?
   - All acceptance criteria met?

4. If validation fails:
   - Log failure reasons
   - Determine which gate to revisit
   - Loop back to appropriate gate

5. If validation passes:
   - Set unit status = "completed"
   - Record gate end timestamp
   - agent_outputs.validation = {
       result: "approved",
       timestamp: "[ISO timestamp]",
       criteria_results: [{criterion, status}]
     }
   - Proceed to Step 7.1 (Execution Unit Approval)
```

## Step 7.1: Execution Unit Approval (Conditional)

**Checkpoint depends on `execution_mode`:** `manual_per_subtask` → Execute | `manual_per_task` / `automatic` → Skip

1. Set `status = "paused_for_approval"`, save state
2. Present summary: Unit ID, Parent Task, Gates 0-5 status, Criteria X/X, Duration, Files Changed
3. **AskUserQuestion:** "Ready to proceed?" Options: (a) Continue (b) Test First (c) Stop Here
4. **Handle response:**

| Response | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Continue | Set in_progress, move to next unit (or Step 7.2 if last) |
| Test First | Set `paused_for_testing`, STOP, output resume command |
| Stop Here | Set `paused`, STOP, output resume command |

## Step 7.2: Task Approval Checkpoint (Conditional)

**Checkpoint depends on `execution_mode`:** `manual_per_subtask` / `manual_per_task` → Execute | `automatic` → Skip

1. Set task `status = "completed"`, cycle `status = "paused_for_task_approval"`, save state
2. Present summary: Task ID, Subtasks X/X, Total Duration, Review Iterations, Files Changed
3. **AskUserQuestion:** "Task complete. Ready for next?" Options: (a) Continue (b) Integration Test (c) Stop Here
4. **Handle response:**

```text
After completing all subtasks of a task:

0. Check execution_mode from state:
   - If "automatic": Still run feedback, then skip to next task
   - If "manual_per_subtask" OR "manual_per_task": Continue with checkpoint below

1. Set task status = "completed"

2. **⛔ MANDATORY: Run dev-feedback-loop skill**

   ```yaml
   Skill tool:
     skill: "dev-feedback-loop"
   ```

   **Note:** dev-feedback-loop manages its own TodoWrite tracking internally.
   
   The skill will:
   - Add its own todo item for tracking
   - Calculate assertiveness score for the task
   - Dispatch prompt-quality-reviewer agent with agent_outputs from state
   - Generate improvement suggestions
   - Write feedback to docs/feedbacks/cycle-{date}/{agent}.md
   - Mark its todo as completed

   **After feedback-loop completes, update state:**
   - Set `tasks[current].feedback_loop_completed = true` in state file

   **Anti-Rationalization for Feedback Loop:**

   | Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
   |-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
   | "Task was simple, skip feedback" | Simple tasks still contribute to patterns | **Execute Skill tool** |
   | "Already at 100% score" | High scores need tracking for replication | **Execute Skill tool** |
   | "User approved, feedback unnecessary" | Approval ≠ process quality metrics | **Execute Skill tool** |
   | "No issues found, nothing to report" | Absence of issues IS data | **Execute Skill tool** |
   | "Time pressure, skip metrics" | Metrics take <2 min, prevent future issues | **Execute Skill tool** |

   **⛔ HARD GATE: You CANNOT proceed to step 3 without executing the Skill tool above.**
   
   **Hook Enforcement:** A UserPromptSubmit hook (`feedback-loop-enforcer.sh`) monitors state and will inject reminders if feedback-loop is not executed.

3. Set cycle status = "paused_for_task_approval"
4. Save state

5. Present task completion summary (with feedback metrics):

   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

6. **ASK FOR EXPLICIT APPROVAL using AskUserQuestion tool:**

   Question: "Task [task_id] complete. Ready to start the next task?"
   Options:
     a) "Continue" - Proceed to next task
     b) "Integration Test" - User wants to test the full task integration
     c) "Stop Here" - Pause cycle

7. Handle user response:

   If "Continue":
     - Set status = "in_progress"
     - Move to next task
     - Set current_task_index += 1
     - Set current_subtask_index = 0
     - Reset to Gate 0
     - Continue execution

   If "Integration Test":
     - Set status = "paused_for_integration_testing"
     - Save state
     - Output: "Cycle paused for integration testing.
                Test task [task_id] integration and run:
                /dev-cycle --resume
                when ready to continue."
     - STOP execution

   If "Stop Here":
     - Set status = "paused"
     - Save state
     - Output: "Cycle paused after task [task_id]. Resume with:
                /dev-cycle --resume"
     - STOP execution
```

**Note:** Tasks without subtasks execute both 7.1 and 7.2 in sequence.

## Step 8: Cycle Completion

1. **Calculate metrics:** total_duration_ms, average gate durations, review iterations, pass/fail ratio
2. **Update state:** `status = "completed"`, `completed_at = timestamp`
3. **Generate report:** Task | Subtasks | Duration | Review Iterations | Status

4. **⛔ MANDATORY: Run dev-feedback-loop skill for cycle metrics**

   ```yaml
   Skill tool:
     skill: "dev-feedback-loop"
   ```

   **Note:** dev-feedback-loop manages its own TodoWrite tracking internally.

   **After feedback-loop completes, update state:**
   - Set `feedback_loop_completed = true` at cycle level in state file

   **⛔ HARD GATE: Cycle is NOT complete until feedback-loop executes.**
   
   **Hook Enforcement:** A UserPromptSubmit hook (`feedback-loop-enforcer.sh`) monitors state and will inject reminders if feedback-loop is not executed.

   | Rationalization | Why It's WRONG | Required Action |
   |-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
   | "Cycle done, feedback is extra" | Feedback IS part of cycle completion | **Execute Skill tool** |
   | "Will run feedback next session" | Next session = never. Run NOW. | **Execute Skill tool** |
   | "All tasks passed, no insights" | Pass patterns need documentation too | **Execute Skill tool** |

5. **Report:** "Cycle completed. Tasks X/X, Subtasks Y, Time Xh Xm, Review iterations X"

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Full PM workflow then dev execution
/pre-dev-full my-feature
/dev-cycle docs/pre-dev/my-feature/

# Simple PM workflow then dev execution
/pre-dev-feature my-feature
/dev-cycle docs/pre-dev/my-feature/tasks.md

# Manual task file
/dev-cycle docs/tasks/sprint-001.md

# Resume interrupted cycle
/dev-cycle --resume
```

## Error Recovery

| Type | Condition | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **Recoverable** | Network timeout | Retry with exponential backoff |
| **Recoverable** | Agent failure | Retry once, then pause for user |
| **Recoverable** | Test flakiness | Re-run tests up to 2 times |
| **Non-Recoverable** | Missing required files | Stop and report |
| **Non-Recoverable** | Invalid state file | Must restart (cannot resume) |
| **Non-Recoverable** | Max review iterations | Pause for user |

**On any error:** Update state → Set status (failed/paused) → Save immediately → Report (what failed, why, how to recover, resume command)

## Execution Report

Base metrics per [shared-patterns/output-execution-report.md](../shared-patterns/output-execution-report.md).

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Duration | Xh Xm Ys |
| Tasks Processed | N/M |
| Current Gate | Gate X - [name] |
| Review Iterations | N |
| Result | PASS/FAIL/IN_PROGRESS |

### Gate Timings
| Gate | Duration | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| Implementation | Xm Ys | in_progress |
| DevOps | - | pending |
| SRE | - | pending |
| Testing | - | pending |
| Review | - | pending |
| Validation | - | pending |
