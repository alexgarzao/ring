# Slide Archetypes

Nine archetypes cover the Lerian editorial deck vocabulary. Each is a self-contained `<section>` pattern. The scaffolded `deck.html` includes one example of each as a starter kit.

**MUST read [layout-rules.md](layout-rules.md) and [design-tokens.md](design-tokens.md) before composing slides.** These archetypes compose primitives from [ui-primitives.md](ui-primitives.md) and charts from [chart-primitives.md](chart-primitives.md).

**Canonicity:** the distilled `../templates/slide-*.html` files are canonical. Each template represents the minimum viable pattern for its archetype — copy the template, then compose primitives and charts into the body.

## Archetype Selection Decision Tree

```
Opening the deck?                     → cover
Showing the agenda?                   → agenda
Major section break?                  → act-divider   (Amarelo, sparingly)
Standard content slide on white?      → content
Same content on paper background?     → content-paper (visual pacing)
Hero statement + supporting metrics?  → content-dark
Big declarative statement?            → content-accent (Amarelo, sparingly)
Transitioning into appendix?          → appendix-intro
Appendix reference material?          → appendix-content
```

## Editorial Discipline

### Use Amarelo sparingly

`.slide.accent` and `.slide.act-divider` both paint the full canvas Amarelo. In a 20-slide deck, **max 2–3 Amarelo slides total** — act dividers plus at most one `content-accent` moment plus the `appendix-intro`. Overuse fatigues the eye; the accent only pops when used rarely.

Per `ui-primitives.md`, `table.grid` is FORBIDDEN on `.slide.accent` (Amarelo bg eats the hairlines) and charts MUST NOT sit on Amarelo backgrounds. If the content needs either, pick `content` or `content-dark`.

### Pagination convention

Three numbering systems run in parallel:

| Range | Format | Example | Runtime behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Main deck | `NN / NN` numeric | `04 / 17` | `deck-stage.js` fills `.page-num` + `.page-total` spans |
| Main deck companion | `NNb / NN` letter-suffix | `09b / 14` | Static — runtime does NOT overwrite. Hard-coded in HTML. |
| Appendix | `AN / N` letter | `A1 / 8` | Static — runtime does NOT overwrite. Hard-coded in HTML. |

**MUST NOT hardcode main-deck numeric pagination.** `.page-num` and `.page-total` spans stay empty in the source; runtime populates them.
**MUST hardcode main-deck companion pagination.** Place `<span class="num">09b / 14</span>` in `meta.right` WITHOUT the `.page-num` class so the runtime leaves it alone. This is a deliberate exception to the dynamic-pagination HARD GATE in [`layout-rules.md`](layout-rules.md#dynamic-pagination).
**MUST hardcode appendix letter pagination.** Place `<span>A1 / 8</span>` in `meta.right` without the `.page-num` class so the runtime leaves it alone.

### Decimal / companion pagination

When a slide is a "zoom-in" follow-on that belongs to the same topic as its predecessor, use a **letter suffix** on the predecessor's slot instead of bumping to a new one: `09 / 14` → `09b / 14`. The main-deck total stays `14` — the companion is *detail*, not a new topic.

**Rules:**

- **Letter suffix signals companion detail.** The audience reads `09b` and understands "this is 09 zoomed in," not "we've added a new section."
- **Use sparingly.** One companion per host slide (`09` + `09b`). If you need a second companion, either the topic is big enough for its own slot (promote to `10`) or the companions belong in the appendix.
- **Total count is unchanged.** Slide 09 and 09b both display the same denominator (`/ 14`). If you see the total bumped, someone confused companions with new slides.
- **Distinct from appendix `AN / N`.** The appendix is reference material the presenter doesn't walk through. Companions are in-flow — the presenter DOES walk through them, and relegating to appendix would break the argument.
- **Runtime override is manual.** The `.page-num` dynamic-fill script in `assets/deck-stage.js` fills `NN` by slide index. Companion slides MUST drop the `.page-num` class so the runtime leaves the hardcoded suffix alone. Author writes `<span class="num">09b / 14</span>` explicitly. See [`layout-rules.md`](layout-rules.md#dynamic-pagination) for the base rule this overrides.

**Example meta.right for a companion slide:**

```html
<div class="meta">
  <div class="left"> … </div>
  <div class="right">
    <span>Board Meeting № 01</span>
    <!-- .num without .page-num — runtime leaves this alone -->
    <span class="num">09b / 14</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

**Anti-pattern:** using letter-suffix as a shortcut to avoid re-paginating when the deck grows. If the new slide is a distinct topic, it's a new slot (`10 / 15`), not a companion (`09b / 14`). Letter suffix is semantic, not procedural.

### Compact density

Apply `data-density="compact"` on individual `<section>` elements when content is denser than the default token spacing allows. This narrows `--pad-x` from 100px to 80px, drops `--t-h1` from 88px to 72px, and shrinks body text to 26px. Use when an appendix card grid has 4+ columns, or when a dense table needs more horizontal room. MUST NOT apply as a global default — the deck is designed at default density.

### Slide chrome invariants

Every content archetype (not cover, not act-divider, not appendix-intro) MUST include:

1. `.meta` top strip — wordmark + context on left, meeting label + page index on right
2. `.body` — `flex: 1; min-height: 0; display: flex; flex-direction: column` wrapper for content
3. `.footer` bottom strip — "Your footer here" + date, `flex-shrink: 0`

The hero archetypes (`cover`, `act-divider`, `appendix-intro`, `content-accent`, `content-dark` statement layouts) skip `.body` and put a `flex: 1; justify-content: center` wrapper directly inside `<section>`. Meta + footer still apply.

---

## cover

**Purpose:** the first impression. Wordmark, meeting identifier, deck title, directors/observers roster.

**When to use:**
- Deck opening. Always slide index 0.
- Once per deck — one cover, no "sub-covers" for acts (those are [act-divider](#act-divider)).
- When the audience needs to know who's in the room before who's presenting.

**When NOT to use:**
- For recurring section opens — that's act-divider territory.
- For internal working drafts where a cover slows the reading — start from agenda.
- As a placeholder — if the deck isn't ready for a cover, leave slide 1 blank and the runtime will surface "speaker-notes length mismatch."

**Composition pattern:**
- `meta` left: wordmark `<span>` + confidentiality label
- `meta` right: date
- Centered column: eyebrow → inline Lerian SVG (220px tall) → Poppins 72px deck title
- Bottom border-top strip: two columns (Directors / Observers) with role annotations

**Reference example:** see [`../templates/slide-cover.html`](../templates/slide-cover.html) (43 lines) for the canonical pattern.

**Common mistakes:**
- Using `<img src="...">` for the wordmark instead of inline SVG — adds an extra request and invites FOUC. `deck.html` inlines the SVG for this reason.
- Omitting the directors/observers strip — the cover is also a roster; without it, the board doesn't see who's accountable for what gets discussed.
- Shrinking the wordmark below 180px — at projection distance, anything smaller reads as "indecisive header" instead of "identity."
- Hardcoding `data-label="Cover"` and then manually numbering later slides in `.meta` — cover is slide index 0 but not paginated; runtime starts counting from slide 2 (first `.body` archetype).
- Pairing the cover with `.slide.dark` — works visually but breaks the reference convention; the cover is the one slide where the white canvas + inline wordmark is the signature.

---

## agenda

**Purpose:** the table of contents. A `table.grid` of acts × themes × time × format, with the debate row highlighted.

**When to use:**
- Second slide (index 1) after the cover.
- Once per deck.
- When the audience benefits from seeing how the time is budgeted — typical for board meetings, not for sales decks.

**When NOT to use:**
- Sales pitches where structure is less important than momentum — drop the agenda, go straight to the story.
- When there are fewer than three acts — a two-row agenda reads as underbaked; merge into a lead slide instead.
- Webinars where the agenda is already in the invite — repeating it kills pacing.

**Composition pattern:**
- Eyebrow: "Agenda"
- h1: time commitment in Poppins with a softened second clause ("Ninety minutes. Half of it on decisions, not reports.")
- `table.grid` with columns: Act | Theme | Time | Format
- `tr.hl` on the row where the real debate happens (e.g., strategic discussions) — this is the visual promise to the audience

**Reference example:** see [`../templates/slide-agenda.html`](../templates/slide-agenda.html) (68 lines) for the canonical pattern.

**Common mistakes:**
- No `tr.hl` row — the Amarelo highlight is the signal that says "here's where you lean in." Without it, the agenda reads as filler.
- Every row using `.num` for ordinals but the "Time" column not — creates visual inconsistency. Both numeric columns use `td.num`.
- Using `<ol>` or `<ul>` instead of `table.grid` — loses the column rhythm that makes the time budget scannable.
- Wide first column — keep "Act" at `width: 100px` so the theme column gets the space.

---

## act-divider

**Purpose:** section break between major acts. Giant Amarelo canvas, huge act number, pill row of upcoming slides.

**When to use:**
- Between main acts of a structured deck. A 5-act deck has 5 act-dividers.
- Once per act.
- When the audience needs a reset — a moment to breathe between dense reports.

**When NOT to use:**
- For every sub-section — act-dividers are for acts, not sections. If every third slide is an Amarelo divider, the Amarelo loses all signal.
- For appendix transitions — that's [appendix-intro](#appendix-intro), which uses "Appendix" instead of `NN / NN` in meta.right.
- For sales decks under 10 slides — act-dividers buy pacing, but a 6-slide deck doesn't need pacing.

**Composition pattern:**
- `.slide.accent` variant (Amarelo background)
- `meta` right shows act-of-acts (`01 / 05`), NOT deck-of-deck pagination
- Hairline rule between "Act NN" mono label and "~N min · N slides" right-aligned
- Act number/title in Poppins 180px
- Lede paragraph in 78%-ink (`rgba(25,26,27,0.78)`)
- Pill row of the next 3–5 slide titles using scoped `.act-pill` class (solid-ink pill + inverted number chip)
- Max 6 pills per row — the reference uses 5. Above 6, the rhythm breaks into chip-noise.

**Reference example:** see [`../templates/slide-act-divider.html`](../templates/slide-act-divider.html) (83 lines) for the canonical pattern.

**Common mistakes:**
- Using `.page-num`/`.page-total` in meta.right — act dividers show act-of-acts, not deck-of-deck. Hardcode `01 / 05`.
- Spelling out the act title in the pill row ("Portfolio — Where We Stand") — pills are short tags, not headlines. Use one or two words.
- Placing act-dividers before the cover — the cover is always slide 1; act-dividers punctuate the body.
- More than 3 act-dividers in a 20-slide deck — the Amarelo becomes noise. Merge small sections.
- Using `table.grid` on an act-divider — FORBIDDEN per `ui-primitives.md` (Amarelo bg eats hairlines).

---

## content

**Purpose:** the workhorse. White background, eyebrow + h1 + lede, then a 2- or 3-column grid of cards, lists, pills, KPIs, or a chart.

**When to use:**
- Any report slide that isn't a hero statement — breakdowns, comparison tables, lists, funnels, matrices.
- 60–80% of a typical deck's body.
- When the content needs room to breathe but isn't a single declarative statement.

**When NOT to use:**
- For single-number hero slides — use [content-dark](#content-dark) or [content-accent](#content-accent).
- For strategic discussions where pacing benefits from a paper tint — use [content-paper](#content-paper).
- For appendix reference material — use [appendix-content](#appendix-content) for letter-paginated chrome.

**Composition pattern:**
- `.meta` with act context ("Act 01 — Section title") in left, page index in right
- `.body` wrapper with `flex: 1; min-height: 0`
- Eyebrow → h1 (up to `max-width: 1600px`) → optional lede
- Main grid: `flex: 1; min-height: 0; display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr)` OR `repeat(2, 1fr)` with ratios like `1fr 1.15fr`
- HARD GATE: the grid MUST have `flex: 1` so it consumes remaining canvas space; `align-items: stretch` so sibling columns match heights.

**Reference example:** see [`../templates/slide-content.html`](../templates/slide-content.html) (104 lines) for the canonical pattern.

**Common mistakes:**
- Missing `flex: 1; min-height: 0` on `.body` — content clings to the top, leaving dead space above the footer. This is the single most common layout failure; `layout-rules.md` calls it out as the canonical bug.
- Hardcoding card heights — breaks the stretch. Let content decide height; let `align-items: stretch` match siblings.
- Using more than 3 columns — 4+ columns at 1920px divide to ~420px each before gaps; body text at 24–28px wraps awkwardly. Split across two slides instead.
- Skipping the eyebrow — the eyebrow is the editorial anchor. Missing eyebrow = orphan headline (see `ui-primitives.md` composition rules).
- Placing a `table.grid` and a `.kpi` grid on the same slide — two ideas per slide breaks the editorial rhythm. One primitive per role per slide.

---

## content-paper

**Purpose:** paper-background variant for visual pacing. Identical grid mechanics to `content`, but the `#F2F2F2` tint signals "pause and discuss."

**When to use:**
- Strategic discussion slides — use this archetype consistently across a discussion act so the audience reads "paper = decide" throughout.
- When a run of white `content` slides has gone on too long and the audience needs a visual reset.
- Paired with a dark inline "Questions for the board" card — the paper/ink contrast is the signature.

**When NOT to use:**
- For straight report content — use `content` (white).
- For Amarelo moments — use `content-accent`.
- As the default for all body slides — if every slide is paper, the pacing signal is gone.

**Composition pattern:**
- `.slide.paper` variant
- Same `.meta` / `.body` / `.footer` scaffold as `content`
- Two-column grid: `1fr 1.15fr` with Context column (ticks list) on left and dark "Questions for the board" card on right
- Dark card uses scoped `.qblock`, `.qnum`, `.qtitle`, `.qbody` classes — numbered rows with Amarelo numerals, Poppins 24px title, IBM Plex Serif 17px body on 75%-white
- Eyebrow-timer pattern at top: "Discussion 01" — hairline — "~12 min"

**Reference example:** see [`../templates/slide-content-paper.html`](../templates/slide-content-paper.html) (98 lines) for the canonical pattern.

**Common mistakes:**
- Using `.slide.paper` without the dark Questions card — the paper tint alone doesn't signal discussion. The contrast between paper bg and inline ink card is what makes the archetype read as "decision needed."
- More than three numbered questions — the card grows too tall and crowds the context column. Split into a follow-up slide.
- Using `ul.numbered` class inside the Questions card — the class exists (see `ui-primitives.md`) but the reference uses the scoped `.qblock` pattern for the Questions-card-on-dark composition. Keep them distinct: `ul.numbered` for light slides, `.qblock` inline pattern for dark cards on paper.
- Putting `content-paper` early in the deck — paper belongs in the discussion act, not in the report acts where it breaks the rhythm.

### Strategic-discussion scaffold

**Sub-template of `content-paper`.** A four-part rhetorical structure for board-facing "we need your input" slides. MUST be used with `.slide.paper` and the dark Questions card — this is not a standalone archetype; it's the disciplined form that `content-paper` takes when a discussion slide asks the board to decide something.

**When to use:**
- Strategic discussions where the board is being asked to weigh in on a specific decision (e.g., go/no-go calls, GTM timing, pricing strategy)
- Any slide where the thesis + evidence + punchline + questions sequence is the argument
- When consistency across 2–4 discussion slides in the same act is editorially load-bearing — repeating the scaffold creates a rhetorical rhythm the audience reads as "decide, decide, decide"

**When NOT to use:**
- Report slides — the scaffold's structure (questions card) doesn't apply
- Discussion slides with no specific question to answer — if you can't name three questions the board can decide, you don't have a discussion slide
- For 2 or 4 questions — the scaffold's rhythm is three. Two feels underbaked; four dilutes focus. See question-count rule below.

**Four-part structure:**

- **Left column** — *thesis (~1fr)*:
  1. **Eyebrow:** "The thesis"
  2. **Prose thesis:** 1–2 paragraphs in IBM Plex Serif, 24–28px body. States the position.
  3. **Supporting block:** exactly one of — [`dual-sided-argument`](ui-primitives.md#dual-sided-argument) card ("Works both ways"), bulleted `ul.ticks` signals list, or an inline evidence block. MUST NOT stack two.
  4. **Accent-colored punchline band:** Poppins 20px weight 600, `background: var(--c-accent); color: var(--c-accent-ink);`, padding `14px 20px`, one-line crystallization. NON-NEGOTIABLE — this is the take-home. Without it, the thesis is just prose.
  5. **Optional market-signals grid:** 2-column, `→` arrow bullets in `var(--c-accent-2)` Verde. Use when the thesis wants external validation alongside the punchline.
- **Right column** — *questions card (~1.1fr, dark)*:
  - `background: var(--c-ink); color: var(--c-ink-inv); padding: 36px 40px; border-radius: 4px;`
  - Eyebrow: "Questions for the board" in Amarelo (`style="color: var(--c-accent);"`)
  - Exactly three questions, each with:
    - `01` / `02` / `03` in JetBrains Mono Amarelo, 16px, padded top 8px
    - Poppins 22px weight 500 title in full white
    - IBM Plex Serif 16px body in `rgba(255,255,255,0.75)` with **bold key phrases** in full white (`color: var(--c-ink-inv); font-weight: 600;`)
  - Dividers between questions: `height: 1px; background: rgba(255,255,255,0.12);`

**HARD RULES:**

- **Exactly three questions.** Not two, not four — three is the rhetorical rhythm the scaffold is built around. If there are four real questions, split into two discussion slides. If there are two, find the third or pick a different archetype.
- **Each question ends with an actual question.** The body MUST terminate with a bolded question the board can answer ("**Do we proceed now, or wait for the next window?**"). Statements dressed as questions ("What do you think?" without specifics) are failed questions.
- **Punchline band is NON-NEGOTIABLE.** The left column without an Amarelo punchline band is not a strategic-discussion scaffold — it's a content-paper slide that happens to have questions on the right. The punchline is the thesis crystallized.
- **Reading order: thesis first, questions second.** Questions card ALWAYS on the right. Placing it on the left violates reading order — the board needs the thesis before the questions land.
- **Max 12 minutes per discussion slide.** Time-boxed by the eyebrow-timer pattern at top of the slide (see `ui-primitives.md` timer-row).

**Composition pattern:**
- `.slide.paper` with the same `.meta` / `.body` / `.footer` scaffold as `content-paper`
- Eyebrow-timer row at top: "Discussion 01" — hairline — "~12 min"
- Main grid: `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1.1fr; gap: 60px;`
- Left column: thesis eyebrow → prose → supporting block → Amarelo punchline band → (optional) market-signals grid
- Right column: dark card with three numbered questions

**Reference example:** see [`../templates/slide-content-paper.html`](../templates/slide-content-paper.html) for the canonical pattern. Compose three consecutive discussion slides using this scaffold for deliberate consistency across a decision act.

**Anti-patterns:**
- "Questions" that are statements wearing a question mark — "What do you think?" without a specific decision is a failed question. Each question ends with a concrete ask.
- Four questions — dilutes focus. The rhythm is three.
- Skipping the Amarelo punchline band — without it, the thesis is prose without a take-home.
- Questions card on the left — violates reading order.
- Reusing the scaffold for report slides — it's for *decisions*, not *updates*.
- Stacking two supporting blocks (e.g., a `ul.ticks` + a `dual-sided-argument`) — pick one. Two crowds the thesis column.

Pairs with: [`dual-sided-argument`](ui-primitives.md#dual-sided-argument) (typical supporting block), [`ticks`](ui-primitives.md#ticks) (alternative supporting block), [`numbered`](ui-primitives.md#numbered) inline dark variant (the Questions card's numeral pattern).

---

## content-dark

**Purpose:** near-black statement slides. High-impact moments — financial KPI walls, capital strategy, single declarative question.

**When to use:**
- KPI walls (4-up horizontal `.kpi` row on dark panel)
- Open-question hero statements (Poppins 110px + bottom strip of 4 metrics)
- Any moment where the content warrants "stop and listen" — `.slide.dark` is the loudest variant without using Amarelo.

**When NOT to use:**
- For standard report content — use `content` (white).
- For multi-column grid content that needs hairline rules — the dark variant's `border-color: rgba(255,255,255,0.18)` works but loses definition. Use `content-paper` when you need rules and room to breathe.
- More than 3 times in a 20-slide deck — `.slide.dark` is punctuation; a run of dark slides exhausts the audience.

**Composition pattern:**
- `.slide.dark` variant
- Eyebrow auto-renders in Amarelo (`.slide.dark .eyebrow { color: var(--c-accent); }`)
- Hero statement region: `flex: 1; justify-content: center` wrapper with Poppins 88–150px text
- Bottom KPI strip: `flex-shrink: 0` row of 3–4 metrics, border-top at 15% white
- Uses scoped `.dark-kpi` class (Poppins 34px inverse-ink) for bottom-strip metrics — distinct from the `.kpi` primitive

**Reference example:** see [`../templates/slide-content-dark.html`](../templates/slide-content-dark.html) (65 lines) for the canonical pattern.

**Common mistakes:**
- Using `.pill` (default outline) on dark — the outline disappears against the dark background. Use `.pill.accent` only, per `ui-primitives.md` pairing table.
- Putting a `table.grid` on dark without inverting rule colors — hairlines invisible on near-black. The reference doesn't use tables on dark slides; if you need one, override `border-color: rgba(255,255,255,0.18)` explicitly.
- Mega text on dark at 240px — on a single-statement dark slide, 88–110px is the sweet spot. 150px feels shouty, 240px feels like a cover.
- Forgetting `.kpi .value` auto-goes white on dark — no explicit color override needed; the base CSS handles it.

---

## content-accent

**Purpose:** Amarelo full-canvas declarative slide. The loudest moment in the deck.

**When to use:**
- One — at most two — times per deck, for a single message that the board must remember.
- When a statement is bigger than any chart or metric could carry (a short declarative phrase that crystallizes the argument).
- As a cliffhanger before an appendix or at the pivot of the deck.

**When NOT to use:**
- For anything supported by data — data slides belong on `content`, `content-paper`, or `content-dark`.
- Back-to-back with another Amarelo slide (act-divider → content-accent → act-divider chains) — the Amarelo burn-in destroys the effect of both slides.
- For discussion openers — Amarelo is "declaration," not "question." Discussions open on `content-paper`.

**Composition pattern:**
- `.slide.accent` variant
- Eyebrow in 72%-ink (`rgba(25,26,27,0.72)`) — auto-applied
- Hero statement in Poppins 150px, `--c-accent-ink` (black) — uses `flex: 1; justify-content: center` to fill canvas
- Optional supporting lede at 78%-ink
- Bottom proof-point strip: 3 `.accent-kpi` tiles (Poppins 72px) + `.accent-cap` mono captions, 18%-ink border-top

**Reference example:** see [`../templates/slide-content-accent.html`](../templates/slide-content-accent.html) (67 lines) for the canonical pattern. This archetype extends the `.slide.accent` pattern (shared with `act-divider` and `appendix-intro`) to a content-bearing statement slide — the Amarelo canvas carries a single declarative punchline rather than a section break.

**Common mistakes:**
- Adding a `table.grid` or chart — FORBIDDEN per `ui-primitives.md` and `chart-primitives.md`. Amarelo bg eats hairlines and collapses chart highlight contrast.
- Using it as a report slide — if the content requires more than one statement, it's not `content-accent`; it's `content` with an Amarelo eyebrow callout.
- Running it next to an act-divider — both Amarelo canvases back-to-back neutralize each other's signal.
- Hero text under 88px — at 1920×1080, Amarelo-on-black needs presence. 150px is the reference default, 110px is the floor.
- Placing `.pill.accent` on `.slide.accent` — Amarelo pill on Amarelo background is invisible. Use `.pill.solid`.

---

## appendix-intro

**Purpose:** transition from main deck to appendix. Amarelo canvas like an act-divider, but signals "what follows is reference material, not presentation flow."

**When to use:**
- Once per deck, between the last main-deck slide and the first appendix slide.
- When the deck has ≥3 appendix slides worth pre-announcing.
- When the appendix contains material the board may want to navigate during Q&A — signaling its availability is the point.

**When NOT to use:**
- For decks without an appendix — no appendix, no `appendix-intro`.
- For "Next Steps" or "Questions" closer slides — those aren't appendix entries.
- If the appendix is a single slide — a single reference slide doesn't warrant a transition.

**Composition pattern:**
- `.slide.accent` variant (same as act-divider — but different meta right)
- `meta` right shows the literal string `Appendix` — NOT `NN / NN`, NOT a letter index
- Eyebrow: "Appendix — A1 through AN" (substitute actual range)
- Giant Poppins 180px title ("Context, on demand.")
- Lede paragraph enumerating the appendix sections

**Reference example:** see [`../templates/slide-appendix-intro.html`](../templates/slide-appendix-intro.html) (29 lines) for the canonical pattern.

**Common mistakes:**
- Using `NN / NN` in meta.right — runtime would happily fill it, but the visual convention is "Appendix" as a standalone word, signaling the role change.
- Making it look different from act-dividers — the audience reads Amarelo-canvas as "section break." `appendix-intro` intentionally reuses the act-divider chrome; the only signal difference is the meta.right word and the absence of a pill-list of upcoming slides.
- Pill row of appendix slides — the appendix is browsed, not presented. No pill row.
- Placing it before an act-divider instead of after the main-deck closer — breaks reading order. Main deck → closer → appendix-intro → A1 → A2 …

## appendix-content

**Purpose:** appendix body slides. Same grid discipline as `content`, but with letter-paginated meta and denser card layouts.

**When to use:**
- Any appendix entry with reference-material density — supporting detail, reference material, deep-dive content, backup data, or technical appendices.
- When the audience is likely to read alone during Q&A rather than during presentation.
- When the content benefits from card grids (3-up, 4-up) rather than hero layouts.

**When NOT to use:**
- For main-deck content — appendix is reference-only. If it belongs in the presentation flow, it belongs on `content`.
- For Amarelo statement slides — the appendix is informational, not declarative.
- For charts — charts belong on main-deck `content` slides where the presenter walks through them. Appendix readers don't get a presenter.

**Composition pattern:**
- `.slide` variant (white)
- `meta` left: wordmark + "· Appendix A1"
- `meta` right: STATIC letter pagination (`<span>A1 / 8</span>`) — NOT `.page-num` / `.page-total` classes. The runtime does NOT overwrite this.
- Eyebrow: "Appendix A1" (matches meta left)
- h1 describes the appendix section
- 3-up or 4-up card grid using scoped `.appendix-card` class (paper-bg summary blocks) with `.appendix-card-title` for Poppins 24–32px body copy
- `data-density="compact"` OPTIONAL — apply when content density exceeds the default token spacing

**Reference example:** see [`../templates/slide-appendix-content.html`](../templates/slide-appendix-content.html) (63 lines) for the canonical pattern.

**Common mistakes:**
- Using `.page-num` / `.page-total` classes on meta.right — the runtime would overwrite `A1 / 8` with `09 / 17`. Plain `<span>A1 / 8</span>` with no runtime-sensitive class is REQUIRED.
- Hero layouts — the appendix is cards and tables, not statements. If the content wants to be a hero, promote it to the main deck.
- Rough letter-pagination (`A1`, `A2`, `A3` inconsistently numbered) — total is fixed. `A1 / 8` through `A8 / 8`, no skips, no gaps.
- Skipping the "· Appendix A1" breadcrumb in meta.left — readers navigating appendix during Q&A lose context without it.
- Putting speaker notes on appendix slides — the array length MUST still match `<section>` count (per `speaker-notes.md`), but notes for appendix slides can be a single short sentence (`"Appendix A1 — reference material. Available for Q&A."`). Don't write 100-word notes for slides nobody presents.
